            " INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Digerati Technologies, Inc. San Antonio, Texas We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Digerati Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Digerati”) as of July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of Digerati’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. Digerati is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Digerati’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Digerati as of July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that Digerati will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Digerati suffered losses from operations and has a working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ LBB & Associates Ltd., LLP LBB & Associates Ltd., LLP Houston, Texas October 24, 2016 PART 1.

AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (In thousands) See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements DIGERATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business. Digerati Technologies, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “Digerati”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 24, 2004. Digerati is a diversified holding company that has no independent operations apart from its subsidiaries. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Shift8 Technologies, Inc., we are an established cloud telephony service provider that offers a comprehensive suite of cloud communication services to meet the global needs of businesses that are seeking simple, flexible, and cost effective communication solutions. Unlike legacy phone systems, our telephony services are delivered Only in the Cloud ™, or over the Internet, making service available to customers from anywhere internet access is available. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Digerati, and its subsidiaries, which are majority owned by Digerati In accordance with ASC 810-10-05. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Reclassifications. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current year for comparative purposes. Use of Estimates. In preparing financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenue and expenses in the statement of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject Digerati to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. In the normal course of business, Digerati provides credit terms to its customers. Accordingly, Digerati performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses, which, when realized, have been within the range of management’s expectations. Digerati maintains cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Digerati has not experienced any losses in such accounts and Digerati does not believe it’s exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. Revenue Recognition. Digerati derives revenue from two product offerings Global VoIP Services and Cloud Communication Services. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been provided, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining. Digerati records and reports its revenue on the gross amount billed to its customers in accordance with the following indicators: ●Digerati is the primary obligor in its arrangements, ●Digerati has latitude in establishing pricing, ●Digerati changes the product or performs part of the service and is involved in the determination of the product or service specifications, ●Digerati has discretion in supplier selection and ●Digerati assumes credit risk for the amount billed to the customer. Sources of revenue: Global VoIP Services: We currently provide VoIP communication services to U.S. and foreign telecommunications companies that lack transmission facilities, require additional capacity or do not have the regulatory licenses to terminate traffic in Mexico, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Typically, these telecommunications companies offer their services to the public for domestic and international long distance services Cloud Communication Services: We provide cloud communication services to value-added resellers and enterprise customers. The service includes fully hosted IP/PBX services, IP trunking, call center applications, prepaid services, interactive voice response auto attendant, call recording, simultaneous calling, voicemail to email conversion, and multiple customized IP/PBX features in a hosted or cloud environment for specialized applications. Cost of Services: Global VoIP Services: We incur transmission and termination charges from our suppliers and the providers of the infrastructure and network. The cost is based on rate per minute, volume of minutes transported and terminated through the network. Additionally, we incur fixed Internet bandwidth charges and per minute billing charges. In some cases we incur installation charges from certain carriers. These installation costs are passed on to our customers for the connection to our VoIP network. Cloud Communication Services: We incur bandwidth, licensing, and co-location charges in connection with cloud communication services. The bandwidth charges are incurred as part of the connection between our customers to allow them access to our services. Cash and cash equivalents. The Company considers all bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Bad debt expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of likely losses each year based on past experience and an estimate of current year uncollectible amounts. As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, Digerati’s allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $0 and $0, respectively. Property and equipment. Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are one to five years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Digerati reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. Digerati assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair value. Derivative financial instruments. Digerati does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. However, Digerati analyzes its convertible instruments and free-standing instruments such as warrants for derivative liability accounting. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For option-based derivative financial instruments, Digerati uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is probable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. Income taxes. Digerati recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. Digerati provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not. Since January 1, 2007, Digerati accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on income taxes which addresses how an entity should recognize, measure and present in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Pursuant to this guidance, Digerati recognizes a tax benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the “more likely than not” standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Currently, we have $2,622,867 in accrued liabilities as of July 31, 2016 and no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded as of July 31, 2015. Stock-based compensation. Digerati accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the provisions on share-based payments which require measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Basic and diluted net loss per share. The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an “as if converted” basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the year ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, potential dilutive securities had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is used which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy based on the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its fair value based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. Our derivative liabilities as of July 31, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and were valued using Level 3 inputs. Recently issued accounting pronouncements. Digerati does not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on Digerati’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN Financial Condition Digerati’s consolidated financial statements for the year ending July 31, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Digerati has incurred net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately $78,076,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $2,516,000 which raises substantial doubt about Digerati’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management Plans to Continue as a Going Concern Management believes that current available resources will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations over the next 12 months. The Company’s ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company will seek to secure such additional funding from various possible sources, including the public equity market, private financings, sales of assets, collaborative arrangements and debt. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds, or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to delay or reduce the scope of its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due. The Company will continue to work with various funding sources to secure additional debt and equity financings. However, Digerati cannot offer any assurance that it will be successful in executing the aforementioned plans to continue as a going concern. Digerati’s consolidated financial statements as of July 31, 2016 do not include any adjustments that might result from the inability to implement or execute Digerati’s plans to improve our ability to continue as a going concern. NOTE 3 - CHAPTER 11 REORGANIZATION On May 30, 2013, Digerati Technologies, Inc., Debtor in Possession (“Digerati”) filed a voluntary petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”), Case No. 13-33264 (the “Bankruptcy”). Digerati filed the petition seeking relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code for the primary purpose of streamlining litigation. On April 4, 2014 (the “Confirmation Date”), the Bankruptcy Court entered an Agreed Order Confirming Joint Plan of Reorganization Filed by Plan Proponents (“Agreed Order”) confirming the Plan Proponents’ Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization as modified on the record on April 4, 2014 and/or as modified by the Agreed Order (the “Reorganization Plan”). As used herein, the term “Reorganized Debtor” refers to Digerati Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation, after the Confirmation Date and as reorganized by the Reorganization Plan. Summary of the Plan This summary is not intended to be a complete description of the Reorganization Plan, and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreed Order, Reorganization Plan, Plan Supplement and Disclosure Statement. A copy of the Agreed Order and Reorganization Plan were filed as exhibits to Digerati’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 11, 2014. (a)The Agreed Order provided final approval of the Disclosure Statement, a copy of which was filed as an exhibit to Digerati’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 23, 2014. (b)Upon the Confirmation Date, the Reorganized Debtor had 1,977,626 shares of common stock outstanding. All outstanding shares of Digerati’s preferred stock, warrants, options, conversion rights and other rights to acquire shares of common stock and all “super voting” shares were cancelled. (c)The Reorganized Debtor’s Board of Directors consisted of Messrs. Arthur L. Smith, William E. McIlwain and James J. Davis. The Reorganized Debtor’s officers, who served at the discretion of the board of directors until the Stockholder Meeting, were: Arthur L. Smith President and Chief Executive Officer Antonio Estrada Jr. Chief Financial Officer Subsequently, on September 15, 2014, the Company held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and at the discretion of the new directors, Mr. Smith and Mr. Estrada continued to serve as officers of the Reorganized Debtor. (d)The Reorganized Debtor was required to hold a Stockholder Meeting to elect a new board of directors after August 31, 2014, and before September 15, 2014. The Reorganized Debtor’s officers and directors, as well as the parties to the BSA and a Rule 11 Mediated Settlement Agreement dated January 14, 2014 (the “Rule 11 Agreement”), were not eligible for election to the new board of directors at the Stockholder Meeting. Messrs. Smith and Estrada were not permitted to solicit proxies in connection with the Stockholder Meeting but were allowed to vote shares of common stock owned by them. Subsequently, on September 15, 2014, the Company held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and new directors were elected. (e)Under the Reorganization Plan title to the issued and outstanding shares of Dishon Disposal, Inc., a North Dakota corporation (“Dishon”), and Hurley Enterprises, Inc., a Montana corporation (“Hurley”), owned by Digerati were transferred to a Grantor Trust subject to existing liens and the Rule 11 Agreement. The Dishon and Hurley shares did not vest in the Reorganized Debtor and remained the property of Digerati’s bankruptcy estate. Additionally, under the Reorganization Plan certain retained litigation claims were transferred to the Grantor Trust. The beneficiary of the Grantor Trust is the Reorganized Debtor. The trustee and Disbursing Agent of the Grantor Trust is Mr. William R. Greendyke. All other assets of Digerati that are not transferred to the Grantor Trust and/or retained by Digerati vested in the Reorganized Debtor as of the Confirmation Date, including but not limited to the common stock of Shift8 Technologies, Inc., free and clear of liens, claims and encumbrances. (f)All of the issued and outstanding shares of Dishon and Hurley were sold by the Grantor Trust and the proceeds from the sale were distributed by the trustee and Disbursing Agent to discharge certain allowed claims. The claims distribution set forth in the Reorganization Plan were as follows: (i)Allowed priority claims were paid in full from cash on hand. (ii)Allowed administrative claims will be paid from the proceeds of the sale of the Dishon and Hurley shares except for those amounts paid pursuant to the budget attached to the Reorganization Plan. The Company estimated the maximum potential amount of any federal income tax liability on the gains derived from the sale of the Dishon and Hurley shares and deposited that amount into a reserve account until determination of the actual taxes due. (iii)Proceeds from the sale of the Dishon shares in excess of $1,250,000 plus one-half of Digerati’s unpaid professional fees (the “Dishon Carve Out”) and amount reserved for taxes were delivered to creditors holding $30,000,000 of Digerati’s indebtedness secured by the Dishon shares, up to the principal of and accrued interest on such indebtedness.

In addition, the secured creditors maintain a right to seek a refund if the estimated amount withheld for taxes on the sale of the Hurley shares exceeds the tax obligation. Principal of or interest on Digerati’s indebtedness secured by the Hurley shares that is in excess of the net proceeds from the sale of Hurley shares has been waived. (v)Allowed unsecured claims of $1,000 or less were paid in full from cash on hand. (vi)Allowed unsecured claims greater than $1,000 were paid in full from the Dishon Carve Out and the Hurley Carve Out.

The Reorganized Debtor also released Messrs. Arthur L. Smith, William McIlwain and James Davis to the greatest extent provided by law from any claims. (x)The Reorganization Plan became effective on December 31, 2014. NOTE 4 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS During fiscal 2008, Digerati made a loan of $150,000 to NetSapiens Inc. The note receivable had a maturity date of June 26, 2008 with interest at 8% per year. The note was secured by NetSapiens’ proprietary Starter Platform License and SNAPsolution modules. On June 26, 2008 Digerati converted the outstanding interest and principal balance into a lifetime and perpetual NetSapiens’ License. The License provides Digerati with the ability to offer Hosted PBX (Private Branch eXchange), IP Centrex application, prepaid calling, call center, conferencing, messaging and other innovative telephony functionality necessary to offer standard and/or custom services to the Residential and Enterprise markets. The NetSapiens’ License is being amortized equally over a period of 10 years. NOTE 5 - PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Following is a summary of Digerati’s property and equipment at July 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): For the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, depreciation and amortization totaled approximately $18,000 and $17,000, respectively. NOTE 6 - DEBT At July 31, 2016 and 2015, outstanding debt consisted of the following: (In thousands). In November 2013, Shift8 Networks, Inc., an operating subsidiary of Digerati, entered into a note payable with Mr. Arthur L. Smith, in the amount of $46,755. The note had an implied annual interest rate of 0% and a maturity date of February 28, 2014. Subsequently, Mr. Smith agreed to extend the maturity date of the promissory note to November 30, 2014 and later agreed to extend the maturity date to April 30, 2015. On January 31, 2015, Shift8 Networks and Mr. Smith agreed to renew and extend the maturity date on the promissory note to October 31, 2015. The renewed note had an implied annual interest rate of 3%. On October 9, 2015 Shift8 Networks paid off the total outstanding principal balance and accrued interest. On August 21, 2015 the Company entered into a short term promissory note payable for $25,000 with Craig K. Clement, the Company’s Chairman of the Board. The note had an implied annual interest rate of 0% and a maturity date of October 31, 2015. On October 15, 2015 the Company paid off the total outstanding principal balance. NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES Digerati files a consolidated tax return. The current tax year is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and certain state taxing authorities. As of July 31, 2016, Digerati had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $1,023,000 to reduce future federal income tax liabilities. Income tax benefit (provision) for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: The effective tax rate for Digerati is reconciled to statutory rates as follows: Deferred tax assets are comprised of the following as of July 31, 2016 and 2015: At July 31, 2016, realization of Digerati’s deferred tax assets was not considered likely to be realized. The change in the valuation allowance for 2016 was approximately $6,075,000. Management has evaluated and concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in Digerati’s combined financial statements. The current year remains open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which Digerati is subject to tax. As a result of the reverse split in 2013 outstanding common shares was 1,977,626 as of July 31, 2014 and the sale of 2,279,412 common shares in January 2015 resulted in a change of control and the net operation loss became subject to the separate return limitation year, thus the net operating loss was reduced. The Company files a calendar year return and the net operating loss was adjusted for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluate on new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. Currently, we have $2,622,867 in accrued liabilities as of July 31, 2016. NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments Digerati leases its office space with monthly payments of $580; the lease is on a month to month basis. The annual rent expense under the operating lease was $7,740 and $8,715 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The future minimum lease payment under the operating lease for fiscal year 2017 is $6,960. Contingencies On May 1, 2014, Recap Marketing & Consulting LLP, Rainmaker Ventures II, Ltd and WEM Equity Capital investments, Ltd. filed an arbitration claim pursuant to the Bankruptcy Settlement Agreement. On July 19, 2014, the arbitrator entered a decision that Recap Marketing & Consulting LLP was entitled to the transfer of 20,600 shares of Digerati Common Stock that were outstanding as of the date of the November Transactions and reflected on Digerati's stockholder list as being held by other stockholders who were principals of Recap Marketing & Consulting, LLP. Recap Marketing & Consulting LLP and Rainmaker Ventures II, Ltd. subsequently challenged the findings of the arbitrator by filing a motion to vacate in In Re Digerati Technologies, Inc. On November 23, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order dismissing the motion vacate. From time to time Digerati is involved in various litigations in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s management believes existing litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of Digerati. NOTE 9 - STOCK -BASED COMPENSATION In November 2015, Digerati adopted the Digerati Technologies, Inc. 2015 Equity Compensation Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan, authorizes the grant of up to 7.5 million stock options, restricted common shares, non-restricted common shares and other awards to employees, directors, and certain other persons. The Plan is intended to permit Digerati to retain and attract qualified individuals who will contribute to the overall success of Digerati. Digerati’s Board of Directors determines the terms of any grants under the Plan. Exercise prices of all stock options and other awards vary based on the market price of the shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The stock options, restricted common stock, non-restricted common stock and other awards vest based on the terms of the individual grant. During the period ended July 31, 2016, we issued: -121,135 common shares to various employees as part of the Company’s profit sharing plan contribution. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of approximately $22,000 equivalent to the value of the shares calculated based on the share’s closing price at the grant dates. As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, Digerati did not have any outstanding options under the Plan. Unamortized compensation cost totaled $0 at July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015. NOTE 10 - WARRANTS During the year ended July 31, 2015, the Company executed a stock purchase agreement with Flagship Oil and Gas Corp. for the sale of 2,279,412 shares of Digerati Common Stock, and warrants for the purchase of an additional 300,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.14 per share for five years. In consideration for the shares and the warrants, the Company received a promissory note in the original principal amount of $310,000 plus interest at the rate of 7.0% per annum, payable in installments of $40,000 plus accrued interest on January 31, 2015; $60,000 plus accrued interest on February 13, 2015; and $210,000 plus accrued interest on March 6, 2015. The Black-Scholes pricing model was used to estimate the relative fair value of the 300,000 warrants issued during the period, using the assumptions of a risk free interest rate of 1.37%, dividend yield of 0%, volatility of 312%, and an expected life of 5 years. The warrants have a relative fair value of approximately $34,627 and included in additional paid-in capital. A summary of the warrants as of July 31, 2016 and 2015 and the changes during the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 are presented below: NOTE 11 - NON-STANDARDIZED PROFIT SHARING PLAN We currently provide a Non-Standardized Profit Sharing Plan, adopted September 15, 2006. Under the plan our employees qualify to participate in the plan after one year of employment. Contributions under the plan are based on 25% of the annual base salary of each eligible employee up to $46,000 per year. Contributions under the plan are fully vested upon funding. During the years ended July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, the Company issued 121,135 and 492,356, respectively, common shares to various employees as part of the Company’s profit sharing plan contribution. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015 of $22,000 and $118,165, respectively, equivalent to the value of the shares calculated based on the share’s closing price at the grant dates. NOTE 12 - SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company derived a significant amount of revenue from four customers, comprising 26%, 19%, 16%, and 13% of the total revenue for the period, respectively, compared to four customers, comprising 20%, 15%, 12%, and 10% of the total revenue for the year ended July 31, 2015. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company derived a significant amount of accounts receivable from one customer, comprising 68% of the total accounts receivable for the period, compared to one customer, comprising 75% of the total accounts receivable for the year ended July 31, 2015.

The note had an implied annual interest rate of 0% and a maturity date of February 28, 2014. Subsequently, Mr. Smith agreed to extend the maturity date of the promissory note to November 30, 2014 and later agreed to extend the maturity date to April 30, 2015. On January 31, 2015, Shift8 Networks and Mr. Smith agreed to renew and extend the maturity date on the promissory note to October 31, 2015. The renewed note had an implied annual interest rate of 3%. On October 9, 2015 Shift8 Networks paid off the total outstanding principal balance and accrued interest. During the year ended July 31, 2015, the Company executed a stock purchase agreement with Flagship Oil and Gas Corp. for the sale of 2,279,412 shares of Digerati Common Stock, and warrants for the purchase of an additional 300,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.14 per share for five years. In consideration for the shares and the warrants, the Company received a promissory note in the original principal amount of $310,000 plus interest at the rate of 7.0% per annum, payable in installments of $40,000 plus accrued interest on January 31, 2015; $60,000 plus accrued interest on February 13, 2015; and $210,000 plus accrued interest on March 6, 2015. The Black-Scholes pricing model was used to estimate the relative fair value of the 300,000 warrants issued during the period, using the assumptions of a risk free interest rate of 1.37%, dividend yield of 0%, volatility of 312%, and an expected life of five years. The warrants have a relative fair value of approximately $34,627 and included in additional paid-in capital. On August 14, 2015, Flagship Oil and Gas Corp. paid $36,065 to the Company for the remaining principal balance and accrued interest associated with the Flagship Notes. On August 21, 2015 the Company entered into a short term promissory note payable for $25,000 with Craig K. Clement, the Company’s Chairman of the Board. The note had an implied annual interest rate of 0% and a maturity date of October 31, 2015. On October 15, 2015 the Company paid off the total outstanding principal balance. NOTE 14 - PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AND JOINT OPERATING AGREEMENT On February 29, 2016 Flagship Energy Company (\"Flagship\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digerati, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (“PSA”) with a Texas-based contract-for-hire oil and gas operator (“Operator”). Under the PSA, Flagship has utilized Operator for the drilling, completion and initial operations of a shallow oil and gas well in conjunction with the purchase of 100% of Operator’s working interest and 80% of its Net Revenue Interest. Under the PSA, the Operator has agreed to transfer all field-level operations and assign 100% of a certain oil, gas and mineral lease to Flagship upon demand, which includes a tract of land located in South Texas. Additionally, Flagship entered into a Joint Operating Agreement (\"JOA\") with Operator, whereby the parties agree to develop the oil and gas well or wells for the production and retrieval of oil and gas commodities as provided for in the oil, gas and mineral lease.

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION INTERSTATE POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY WISCONSIN POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES NOTE 1(a) General - Description of Business - Alliant Energy’s financial statements include the accounts of Alliant Energy and its consolidated subsidiaries. Alliant Energy is an investor-owned public utility holding company, whose primary wholly-owned subsidiaries are IPL, WPL, AEF and Corporate Services. IPL’s financial statements include the accounts of IPL and its consolidated subsidiary, IPL SPE LLC, which is used for IPL’s sales of accounts receivable program. IPL is a direct subsidiary of Alliant Energy and is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas to retail customers in select markets in Iowa. IPL also sells electricity to wholesale customers in Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa, and is engaged in the generation and distribution of steam for two customers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. WPL’s financial statements include the accounts of WPL and its consolidated subsidiary, WPL Transco, which held Alliant Energy’s investment in ATC until December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 6(a) for discussion of WPL’s transfer of its investment in ATC to ATI on December 31, 2016. WPL is a direct subsidiary of Alliant Energy and is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas to retail customers in select markets in Wisconsin. WPL also sells electricity to wholesale customers in Wisconsin. AEF is comprised of Transportation, Non-regulated Generation, ATI and other non-regulated investments. Transportation includes a short-line railway that provides freight service between Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; barge terminal and hauling services on the Mississippi River; and other transfer and storage services. Non-regulated Generation owns Sheboygan Falls, a 347 MW, simple-cycle, natural gas-fired EGU near Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, which is leased to WPL for an initial period of 20 years ending in 2025. In addition, Non-regulated Generation currently owns the non-regulated 99 MW Franklin County wind farm located in Franklin County, Iowa. In February 2017, FERC issued an order approving the transfer of the Franklin County wind farm from AEF to IPL. Alliant Energy and IPL currently expect to complete this transfer in 2017. ATI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF, held a partial interest in WPL Transco until December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, ATI holds all of Alliant Energy’s investment in ATC. Refer to Note 6(a) for further discussion of the transfer of WPL’s ATC investment to ATI. Corporate Services is the subsidiary formed to provide administrative services to Alliant Energy and its subsidiaries. Basis of Presentation - The financial statements reflect investments in controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s proportionate shares of jointly-owned utility EGUs. Unconsolidated investments, which Alliant Energy and WPL do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, Alliant Energy and WPL initially record the investment at cost, and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize their respective share of the earnings or losses of the investee. Dividends received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the equity investment. Investments that do not meet the criteria for consolidation or the equity method of accounting are accounted for under the cost method. Refer to Notes 1(m) and 6(a) for further discussion of VIEs and equity method investments, respectively. All intercompany balances and transactions, other than certain transactions affecting the rate-making process at IPL and WPL, have been eliminated from the financial statements. Such transactions not eliminated include costs that are recoverable from customers through rate-making processes. The financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which give recognition to the rate-making and accounting practices of FERC and state commissions having regulatory jurisdiction. Certain prior period amounts in the Financial Statements and Notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation for comparative purposes. Unless otherwise noted, the notes herein exclude discontinued operations for all periods presented. As discussed in Note 7, all Alliant Energy share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a two-for-one common stock split distributed in May 2016. As required by GAAP, all prior period financial statements and disclosures presented herein have been restated to reflect the common stock split. Use of Estimates - The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect: (a) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and (b) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. NOTE 1(b) Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by FERC and various state regulatory commissions. As a result, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to GAAP provisions for regulated operations, which provide that rate-regulated public utilities record certain costs and credits allowed in the rate-making process in different periods than for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred as such costs are probable of recovery in future customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers or amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred. Amounts deferred as regulatory assets or accrued as regulatory liabilities are generally recognized in the income statements at the time they are reflected in rates. Refer to Note 2 for additional discussion of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities. NOTE 1(c) Income Taxes - The liability method of accounting is followed for deferred taxes, which requires the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as appropriate, for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the financial statements. Deferred taxes are recorded using currently enacted tax rates and estimates of state apportionment. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with certain property-related differences at IPL are accounted for differently than other subsidiaries of Alliant Energy due to rate-making practices in Iowa. Rate-making practices in Iowa do not include the impact of certain deferred tax expenses (benefits) in the determination of retail rates. Based on these rate-making practices, deferred tax expense (benefit) related to these property-related differences at IPL is not recorded in the income statement but instead recorded to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities until these temporary differences reverse. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of these tax regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities associated with property-related differences at IPL. In Wisconsin, the PSCW has allowed rate recovery of deferred tax expense on all temporary differences since 1991. Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over the average lives of the related property. Other tax credits reduce income tax expense in the year claimed. Alliant Energy files a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined return in Wisconsin, which include Alliant Energy and its subsidiaries. Alliant Energy subsidiaries with a presence in Iowa file as part of a consolidated return in Iowa. Alliant Energy allocates consolidated income tax expense to its subsidiaries that are members of the group that file a consolidated or combined income tax return. IPL and WPL use the modified separate return approach for calculating their income tax provisions and related deferred tax assets and liabilities. IPL and WPL are assumed to file separate tax returns with the federal and state taxing authorities, except that net operating losses (and other current or deferred tax attributes) are characterized as realized (or realizable) by IPL and WPL when those tax attributes are realized (or realizable) by the consolidated tax return group of Alliant Energy (even if IPL and WPL would not otherwise have realized the attributes on a stand-alone basis). The difference in the income taxes recorded for IPL and WPL under the modified separate return method compared to the income taxes recorded on a separate return basis was not material in 2016, 2015 and 2014. NOTE 1(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include short-term liquid investments that have original maturities of less than 90 days. NOTE 1(e) Property, Plant and Equipment - Utility Plant - General - Utility plant is recorded at the original cost of acquisition or construction, which includes material, labor, contractor services, AFUDC and allocable overheads, such as supervision, engineering, benefits, certain taxes and transportation. Repairs, replacements and renewals of items of property determined to be less than a unit of property or that do not increase the property’s life or functionality are charged to maintenance expense. Generally, ordinary retirements of utility plant and salvage value are netted and charged to accumulated depreciation upon removal from utility plant accounts and no gain or loss is recognized consistent with rate-making policies. However, if regulators have approved recovery of the remaining net book value of property, plant and equipment that is retired early, the remaining net book value is reclassified from property, plant and equipment to regulatory assets upon retirement. Property, plant and equipment that is probable of being retired early is classified as plant anticipated to be retired early. Depreciation - IPL and WPL use a combination of remaining life and straight-line depreciation methods as approved by their respective regulatory commissions. The composite or group method of depreciation is used, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property. This method pools similar assets and then depreciates each group as a whole. Periodic depreciation studies are performed to determine the appropriate group lives, net salvage, estimated cost of removal and group depreciation rates. These depreciation studies are subject to review and approval by IPL’s and WPL’s respective regulatory commissions. Depreciation expense is included within the recoverable cost of service component of rates charged to customers. The average rates of depreciation for electric, gas and other properties, consistent with current rate-making practices, were as follows: In September 2016, the PSCW issued an order approving the implementation of updated depreciation rates for WPL effective January 1, 2017 as a result of a recently completed depreciation study. WPL estimates the new average rates of depreciation for its electric generation, electric distribution and gas properties will be approximately 3.2%, 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively, during 2017. AFUDC - AFUDC represents costs to finance construction additions, including a return on equity component and cost of debt component as required by regulatory accounting. AFUDC for IPL’s construction projects is calculated in accordance with FERC guidelines. AFUDC for WPL’s retail and wholesale jurisdiction construction projects is calculated in accordance with PSCW and FERC guidelines, respectively. The AFUDC rates, computed in accordance with the prescribed regulatory formula, were as follows: (a) In 2013, the IUB issued an order establishing rate-making principles for Marshalltown that requires a 10.3% return on common equity for the calculation of AFUDC related to the construction of such facility. In accordance with their most recent rate orders, IPL applies its AFUDC rates to 100% of applicable CWIP balances and WPL generally applies its AFUDC rates to 50% of applicable CWIP balances. WPL may apply its AFUDC rates to 100% of the retail portion of the CWIP balances for construction projects requiring a CA or CPCN that were approved by the PSCW after its most recent rate order, including the Riverside expansion. Non-utility Property - General - Non-utility property is recorded at the original cost of acquisition or construction, which includes material, labor and contractor services. Repairs, replacements and renewals of items of property determined to be less than a unit of property or that do not increase the property’s life or functionality are charged to maintenance expense. Upon retirement or sale of non-utility property, the original cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the income statements. Costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related software. If software is retired prior to being fully amortized, the difference is recorded as a loss in the income statements. NOTE 1(f) Operating Revenues - Utility - Revenues from Alliant Energy’s utility business are primarily from electricity and natural gas sales and are recognized on an accrual basis as services are rendered or commodities are delivered to customers. Energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of customers’ meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout each reporting period. Amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated at the end of each reporting period and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is recorded in such reporting period. The unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes, estimated customer usage by class, temperature impacts, line losses and the most recent customer rates. IPL and WPL accrue revenues from their wholesale customers to the extent that the actual net revenue requirements calculated in accordance with FERC-approved formula rates for the reporting period are higher or lower than the amounts billed to wholesale customers during such period. Regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities are recorded as the offset for these accrued revenues under formulaic rate-making programs. IPL’s estimated recovery amount is recorded in the current period of service and is reflected in customer bills within two years under the provisions of approved formula rates. WPL’s estimated recovery amount is recorded in the current period of service and subject to final adjustments after a customer audit period in the subsequent year. Final settled recovery amounts are reflected in WPL’s customer bills within two years under the provisions of approved formula rates. IPL and WPL participate in bid/offer-based wholesale energy and ancillary services markets operated by MISO. MISO requires that all load serving entities and generation owners, including IPL and WPL, submit hourly day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for energy and ancillary services. The MISO day-ahead and real-time transactions are grouped together, resulting in a net supply to or net purchase from MISO for each hour of each day. The net supply to MISO is recorded in “Electric utility operating revenues” and the net purchase from MISO is recorded in “Electric production fuel and purchased power” in the income statements. Non-regulated - Revenues from Alliant Energy’s non-regulated businesses are primarily from its Transportation business and are recognized on an accrual basis as services are rendered or goods are delivered to customers. Taxes Collected from Customers - Sales or various other taxes collected by certain of Alliant Energy’s subsidiaries on behalf of other agencies are recorded on a net basis and are not included in operating revenues. Revenue Recognition - Refer to Note 1(o) for discussion of a new accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in 2014, which provides principles for recognizing revenue. NOTE 1(g) Utility Cost Recovery Mechanisms - Electric Production Fuel and Purchased Power (Fuel-related Costs) - Fuel-related costs are incurred to generate and purchase electricity to meet the demand of IPL’s and WPL’s electric customers. These fuel-related costs include the cost of fossil fuels (primarily natural gas and coal) used to produce electricity at their EGUs, electricity purchased from MISO wholesale energy markets and under PPAs, costs for allowances acquired to allow certain emissions (primarily SO2 and NOx) from their EGUs and costs for chemicals utilized to control emissions from their EGUs. These fuel-related costs are recorded in “Electric production fuel and purchased power” in the income statements. IPL Retail - The cost recovery mechanisms for IPL’s retail electric customers provide for monthly adjustments to their electric rates for changes in fuel-related costs. Fuel adjustment clause rules applicable to IPL’s retail jurisdiction also allow recovery of prudently incurred costs for emission allowances required to comply with EPA regulations through the fuel adjustment clause. Changes in the under-/over-collection of these costs are recognized in “Electric production fuel and purchased power” in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s income statements. The cumulative effects of the under-/over-collection of these costs are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. WPL Retail - The cost recovery mechanism for WPL’s retail electric customers is based on forecasts of certain fuel-related costs expected to be incurred during forward-looking test year periods and fuel monitoring ranges determined by the PSCW during each retail electric rate proceeding or in a separate fuel cost plan approval proceeding. If WPL’s actual fuel-related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges, WPL is authorized to defer the incremental under-/over-collection of fuel-related costs that are outside the approved ranges. Deferral of under-collections are reduced to the extent actual return on common equity earned by WPL during the fuel cost plan year exceeds the most recently authorized return on common equity. Deferred amounts for fuel-related costs outside the approved fuel monitoring ranges are recognized in “Electric production fuel and purchased power” in Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s income statements. The cumulative effects of these deferred amounts are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. IPL and WPL Wholesale - The cost recovery mechanisms for IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale electric customers provide for subsequent adjustments to their electric rates for changes in fuel-related costs. Changes in the under-/over-collection of these costs are recognized in “Electric production fuel and purchased power” in the income statements. The cumulative effects of the under-/over-collection of these costs are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. IPL’s and WPL’s costs for emission allowances are excluded from the fuel- related cost recovery mechanisms and are recovered from their wholesale electric customers through annual changes in base rates determined by a formula rate structure. Purchased Electric Capacity - PPAs help meet the electricity demand of IPL’s and WPL’s customers. Certain of these PPAs include minimum payments for IPL’s and WPL’s rights to electric generating capacity, which are charged each period to “Electric production fuel and purchased power” in the income statements. Purchased electric capacity expenses are recovered from IPL’s and WPL’s retail electric customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings. Purchased electric capacity expenses are recovered from IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale electric customers through annual changes in base rates determined by a formula rate structure. Electric Transmission Service - Costs incurred for the transmission of electricity to meet the demands of IPL’s and WPL’s customers are charged to “Electric transmission service” in the income statements. IPL Retail - Electric transmission service expense is recovered from IPL’s retail electric customers through a transmission cost rider. This cost recovery mechanism provides for annual adjustments to electric rates charged to retail electric customers for changes in electric transmission service expense. Changes in the under-/over-collection of these costs are recognized in “Electric transmission service” in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s income statements. The cumulative effects of the under-/over-collection of these costs are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. The transmission cost rider will remain in effect until the IUB’s final decision in IPL’s next retail electric base rate case, at which time the rider will continue in its current form, continue in a modified form or be terminated. WPL Retail - Electric transmission service expense is recovered from WPL’s retail electric customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings. Pursuant to the escrow accounting treatment WPL received as part of its approved retail electric rate case (2015/2016 Test Period) in 2014 from the PSCW, the difference between actual electric transmission service expense incurred and the amount of electric transmission service costs collected from customers as electric revenues in 2015 and 2016 is recognized in “Electric transmission service” in Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s income statements. An offsetting amount is recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s balance sheets until reflected in future billings to customers. The PSCW’s December 2016 order for WPL’s retail electric rate case (2017/2018 Test Period) extends this escrow accounting treatment through 2018. IPL and WPL Wholesale - IPL and WPL arrange transmission service for the majority of their respective wholesale electric customers. Electric transmission service expense is allocated to and recovered from these customers based on a load ratio share computation. Cost of Gas Sold - Costs are incurred for the purchase, transportation and storage of natural gas to serve IPL’s and WPL’s gas customers and the costs associated with the natural gas delivered to customers are charged to “Cost of gas sold” in the income statements. The tariffs for IPL’s and WPL’s retail gas customers provide for subsequent adjustments to their rates each month for changes in the cost of gas sold. Changes in the under-/over-collection of these costs are also recognized in “Cost of gas sold” in the income statements. The cumulative effects of the under-/over-collection of these costs are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. Energy Efficiency Costs - Costs are incurred to fund energy efficiency programs and initiatives that help customers reduce their energy usage. The costs incurred for these programs and initiatives are charged to “Other operation and maintenance” in the income statements. Energy efficiency costs incurred by IPL are recovered from its retail electric and gas customers through an additional tariff called an energy efficiency cost recovery factor, which is revised annually and includes a reconciliation to eliminate any under-/over-collection of energy efficiency costs from prior periods. Energy efficiency costs incurred by WPL are recovered from retail electric and gas customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings. Reconciliations of any under-/over-collection of energy efficiency costs from prior periods are also addressed in WPL’s periodic rate proceedings. Changes in the under-/over-collection of energy efficiency costs for IPL and WPL are recognized in “Other operation and maintenance” in the income statements. The cumulative effects of the under-/over-collection of these costs for IPL and WPL are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. Refer to Note 2 for additional information regarding these utility cost recovery mechanisms. NOTE 1(h) Financial Instruments - Financial instruments are periodically used for risk management purposes to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in certain commodity prices and transmission congestion costs. The fair value of those financial instruments that are determined to be derivatives are recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheets. Certain commodity purchase and sales contracts qualify for and have been designated under the normal purchase and sale exception and are accounted for on the accrual basis of accounting. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have elected to not net the fair value amounts of derivatives subject to a master netting arrangement by counterparty. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL do not offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (payable) against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments that are executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. Refer to Note 2 for discussion of the recognition of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities related to the unrealized losses and gains on IPL’s and WPL’s derivative instruments. Refer to Notes 14, 15 and 16(f) for further discussion of derivatives and related credit risk. NOTE 1(i) Asset Impairments - Property, Plant and Equipment of Regulated Operations - Property, plant and equipment of regulated operations are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate all or a portion of the carrying value of the assets may be disallowed for rate-making purposes. If IPL or WPL are disallowed recovery of any portion of the carrying value of their regulated property, plant and equipment that is under construction, has been recently completed or is probable of abandonment, or conclude it is probable recovery will be disallowed, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value that was disallowed or is probable of being disallowed. If IPL or WPL are only allowed a partial return on the carrying value of their regulated property, plant and equipment that is under construction, has been recently completed or is probable of abandonment, or conclude it is probable a full return will not be allowed, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value and the present value of the future revenues expected from their regulated property, plant and equipment. Property, Plant and Equipment of Non-regulated Operations - Property, plant and equipment of non-regulated operations are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted future cash flows. If an impairment is indicated, a charge is recognized equal to the amount the carrying value exceeds the asset’s fair value. Refer to Note 3 for discussion of Alliant Energy’s impairment analysis of the Franklin County wind farm assets in 2016 and resulting asset valuation charges recorded by Alliant Energy in 2016. Unconsolidated Equity Investments - If events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting exceeds fair value and the decline in value is other than temporary, potential impairment is assessed. If an impairment is indicated, a charge is recognized equal to the amount the carrying value exceeds the investment’s fair value. Refer to Note 6(a) for additional discussion of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting. NOTE 1(j) Asset Retirement Obligations - The fair value of a legal obligation associated with the retirement of an asset is recorded as a liability when an asset is placed in service, when a legal obligation is subsequently identified or when sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of future retirement costs. When an ARO is recorded as a liability, an equivalent amount is added to the asset cost. The fair value of AROs at inception is determined using discounted cash flows analyses. The liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Accretion and depreciation expenses related to AROs for IPL’s and WPL’s regulated operations are recorded to regulatory assets on the balance sheets. Upon regulatory approval to recover IPL’s AROs expenditures, its regulatory assets are amortized to depreciation and amortization expenses in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s income statements over the same time period the ARO expenditures are recovered from IPL’s customers. WPL’s regulatory assets related to AROs are being recovered as a component of depreciation rates pursuant to PSCW and FERC orders. Accretion and depreciation expenses related to AROs for Alliant Energy’s non-regulated operations are recorded to depreciation and amortization expenses in Alliant Energy’s income statements. Upon settlement of the ARO liability, an entity settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss. Any gains or losses related to AROs for IPL’s and WPL’s regulated operations are recorded to regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets on the balance sheets. Refer to Note 13 for additional discussion of AROs. NOTE 1(k) Debt Issuance and Retirement Costs - Debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, and are deferred and amortized over the expected life of each debt issue, considering maturity dates and, if applicable, redemption rights held by others. Alliant Energy’s non-regulated businesses and Corporate Services expense in the period of retirement any unamortized debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts on debt retired early. Refer to Note 2 for information on regulatory assets related to IPL’s and WPL’s debt retired early or refinanced. NOTE 1(l) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on historical write-offs, customer arrears and other economic factors within IPL’s and WPL’s service territories. Refer to Note 5(a) for details of allowance for doubtful accounts. NOTE 1(m) Variable Interest Entities - An entity is considered a VIE if its equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or its equity investors lack any of the following characteristics: (1) power, through voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; (2) the obligation to absorb expected losses of the entity; or (3) the right to receive expected benefits of the entity. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. The financial statements did not reflect any VIEs on a consolidated basis. NOTE 1(n) Cash Flows Presentation - Alliant Energy presents cash flows from continuing operations together with cash flows from discontinued operations in its cash flows statements. NOTE 1(o) New Accounting Standards - Revenue Recognition - In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standard providing principles for recognizing revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers with the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard also requires disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect to adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. Upon adoption, the standard can be applied retrospectively to all prior reporting periods presented, or retrospectively with a cumulative effect to the opening retained earnings balance on January 1, 2018. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on their financial condition and results of operations and do not anticipate a significant change in revenue recognition for retail electric and gas sales, which represent the majority of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s revenues. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL continue to evaluate additional impacts of this standard, as well as which transition method will be utilized. Leases - In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standard requiring lease assets and lease liabilities, including operating leases, to be recognized on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The standard also requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect to adopt this standard on January 1, 2019 and are evaluating the impact of this standard on their financial condition and results of operations and expect an increase in assets and liabilities from recognizing operating leases on their balance sheets. Share-based Compensation Award Payments - In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standard intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation award payments and the associated income taxes. This standard changes the accounting for excess tax benefits, whereby such benefits are recognized in the income statement instead of additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. Alliant Energy adopted this standard on January 1, 2016, which resulted in a cumulative effect of a decrease to its deferred tax liabilities and an increase to its January 1, 2016 retained earnings balance of $3.1 million, which is included in “Other” in Alliant Energy’s common equity statement in 2016. NOTE 2. REGULATORY MATTERS Regulatory Assets - At December 31, regulatory assets were comprised of the following items (in millions): A portion of the regulatory assets in the above table are not earning a return. These regulatory assets, but not the respective carrying costs of these regulatory assets, are expected to be recovered from customers in future rates. At December 31, 2016, IPL and WPL had $44 million and $9 million, respectively, of regulatory assets representing past expenditures that were not earning a return. IPL’s regulatory assets that were not earning a return consisted primarily of emission allowances, debt redemption costs, and costs for clean air compliance and wind generation expansion projects. WPL’s regulatory assets that were not earning a return consisted primarily of amounts related to the wholesale portion of under-collected fuel-related costs, which is discussed in Note 1(g), and environmental-related costs. The other regulatory assets reported in the above table either earn a return or the cash has not yet been expended, in which case the assets are offset by liabilities that also do not incur a carrying cost. Tax-related - IPL and WPL record regulatory assets for certain temporary differences (primarily related to utility property, plant and equipment at IPL) that result in a decrease in current rates charged to customers and an increase in future rates charged to customers based on the timing of income tax expense that is used to determine such rates. These temporary differences for IPL include the impacts of qualifying deductions for repairs expenditures, allocation of mixed service costs, and Iowa accelerated tax depreciation, which all contribute to lower current income tax expense during the first part of an asset’s useful life and higher current tax expense during the last part of an asset’s useful life. These regulatory assets will be recovered from customers in the future when these temporary differences reverse resulting in additional current income tax expense used to determine customers’ rates. During 2016, Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s tax-related regulatory assets increased primarily due to property-related differences for qualifying repair expenditures. Pension and other postretirement benefits costs - The IUB and the PSCW have authorized IPL and WPL to record the retail portion of their respective previously unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses, and prior service costs and credits, as regulatory assets in lieu of AOCL on the balance sheets, as these amounts are expected to be recovered in future rates. IPL and WPL also recognize the wholesale portion of their previously unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses, and prior service costs and credits, as regulatory assets on the balance sheets because these amounts are expected to be recovered in rates in future periods under the formula rate structure. These regulatory assets will be increased or decreased as the net actuarial gains or losses, and prior service costs or credits, are subsequently amortized and recognized as a component of net periodic benefit costs. Regulatory assets are also increased or decreased as a result of the annual defined benefit plan measurement process. Pension and OPEB costs are included within the recoverable cost of service component of rates charged to IPL’s and WPL’s customers. The recoverable costs included in customers’ rates are based upon pension and OPEB costs determined in accordance with GAAP and are calculated using different methods for IPL’s and WPL’s respective regulatory jurisdictions. The IUB authorized IPL in its 2009 Test Year Iowa retail electric rate case order to recover from its retail electric customers in Iowa an allocated portion of annual costs equal to a two-year simple average of actual costs incurred during its 2009 Test Year and an estimate of costs for its forward-looking post-Test Year (2010). The PSCW has authorized WPL to recover from its retail electric and gas customers an estimated allocated portion of annual costs equal to the costs expected to be incurred during each test period. IPL and WPL are authorized to recover from their wholesale customers an allocated portion of actual pension costs incurred each year through FERC-approved formula rates. Refer to Note 12(a) for additional details regarding pension and OPEB costs. AROs - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe it is probable that any differences between expenses accrued for legal AROs related to their regulated operations and expenses recovered currently in rates will be recoverable in future rates, and are deferring the differences as regulatory assets. Refer to Note 13 for additional details of AROs. WPL’s electric generating units retired early - In December 2015, WPL retired Nelson Dewey Units 1 and 2 and Edgewater Unit 3. WPL received approval from the PSCW and FERC to reclassify the remaining net book value of these EGUs from property, plant and equipment to a regulatory asset on Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s balance sheets. The remaining net book value is included in WPL’s rate base and WPL is earning a return on the outstanding balance. WPL is currently recovering the remaining net book value of these EGUs from both its retail and wholesale customers over a 10-year period beginning January 1, 2013 pursuant to PSCW and FERC orders. Derivatives - In accordance with IPL’s and WPL’s fuel and natural gas recovery mechanisms, prudently incurred costs from derivative instruments are recoverable from customers in the future after any losses are realized, and gains from derivative instruments are refundable to customers in the future after any gains are realized. Based on these recovery mechanisms, the changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities/assets resulted in comparable changes to regulatory assets/liabilities on the balance sheets. Refer to Note 15 for additional details of derivative assets and derivative liabilities. Emission allowances - IPL entered into forward contracts in 2007 to purchase SO2 emission allowances with vintage years of 2014 through 2017 from various counterparties to meet future CAIR emission reduction standards. Any SO2 emission allowances acquired under these forward contracts could be used to meet requirements under the existing Acid Rain program regulations or the more stringent CAIR emission reduction standards but are not eligible to be used for compliance requirements under CSAPR. In 2011, the EPA issued CSAPR to replace CAIR with an anticipated effective date in 2012. As a result of the issuance of CSAPR, Alliant Energy and IPL concluded in 2011 that the allowances to be acquired under these forward contracts would not be needed by IPL to comply with expected environmental regulations in the future. Alliant Energy and IPL have recorded a regulatory asset for amounts paid under the forward contracts, as well as for the remaining obligation under the forward contracts as a result of concluding the amount is probable of recovery from IPL’s customers. Commodity cost recovery - Refer to Note 1(g) for additional details of IPL’s and WPL’s cost recovery mechanisms. Other - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL assess whether IPL’s and WPL’s regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulations, recent orders by the applicable regulatory agencies, historical treatment of similar costs by the applicable regulatory agencies and regulatory environment changes. Based on these assessments, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe the regulatory assets recognized as of December 31, 2016 in the above table are probable of future recovery. However, no assurance can be made that IPL and WPL will recover all of these regulatory assets in future rates. If future recovery of a regulatory asset ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset will be charged to expense in the period the likelihood of future recovery is less than probable. Regulatory Liabilities - At December 31, regulatory liabilities were comprised of the following items (in millions): Regulatory liabilities related to cost of removal obligations, to the extent expensed through depreciation rates, reduce rate base. A significant portion of the remaining regulatory liabilities are not used to reduce rate base in the revenue requirement calculations utilized in IPL’s and WPL’s respective rate proceedings. Cost of removal obligations - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL collect in rates future removal costs for many assets that do not have associated legal AROs. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL record a regulatory liability for the estimated amounts they have collected in rates for these future removal costs and reduce the regulatory liability for amounts spent on removal activities. IPL’s tax benefit riders - The IUB has approved electric and gas tax benefit riders proposed by IPL, which utilize regulatory liabilities to credit bills of IPL’s Iowa retail electric and gas customers to help offset the impact of rate increases on such customers. Alliant Energy and IPL recognize an offsetting reduction to income tax expense for the after-tax amounts credited to such customers, resulting in no impact to their net income from the electric and gas tax benefit riders. The tax benefit riders regulatory liabilities are related to tax benefits from tax accounting method changes for repairs expenditures, allocation of mixed service costs, allocation of insurance proceeds from floods in 2008, and cost of removal expenditures. In 2016, Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s “IPL’s tax benefit riders” regulatory liabilities decreased by $76 million as follows (in millions): In December 2016, the IUB authorized $68 million and $7 million of regulatory liabilities from tax benefits to be credited to IPL’s retail electric and gas customers’ bills in 2017 through the electric and gas tax benefit riders, respectively. Any remaining tax benefit rider regulatory liabilities are currently expected to be credited to IPL’s retail electric and gas customers’ bills in the future, subject to final review by the IUB. Electric tax benefit rider - Details for IPL’s electric tax benefit rider are as follows (in millions): The IUB authorized IPL to reduce the electric tax benefit rider billing credits on customers’ bills for 2013 through 2016 to recognize the revenue requirement impact of the changes in tax accounting methods related to tangible property and mixed service costs. The revenue requirement adjustment resulted in increases to electric revenues in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s income statements and was recognized through the energy adjustment clause as a reduction of the credits on IPL’s Iowa retail electric customers’ bills from the electric tax benefit rider as follows (in millions): Gas tax benefit rider - Details for IPL’s gas tax benefit rider are as follows (in millions): Electric transmission cost recovery - Refer to Note 1(g) for additional details of IPL’s and WPL’s electric transmission service cost recovery mechanisms. Commodity cost recovery - Refer to Note 1(g) for additional details of IPL’s and WPL’s commodity cost recovery mechanisms. Energy efficiency cost recovery - WPL and IPL collect revenues from their customers to offset certain expenditures they each incur for energy efficiency programs, including state mandated programs and Shared Savings programs. Differences between forecasted costs used to set rates and actual costs for these programs are deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. The PSCW’s order for WPL’s 2015/2016 Test Period electric and gas base rate case authorized energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations for 2016, which contributed to the decrease in Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s “Energy efficiency cost recovery” regulatory liabilities. Utility Rate Cases - WPL’s Wisconsin Retail Electric and Gas Rate Case (2017/2018 Test Period) - In December 2016, WPL received an order from the PSCW authorizing WPL to implement increases in annual retail electric and gas base rates of $9 million and $9 million, respectively, effective January 1, 2017 followed by a freeze of such rates through the end of 2018. The key drivers for the electric and gas base rate increases are recovery of the costs for environmental controls projects at Edgewater and Columbia, and investments in electric and gas distribution systems, including expansion of natural gas pipeline infrastructure. The filing also included utilization of amounts that WPL previously over-recovered from its customers for energy efficiency cost recovery and electric transmission cost recovery, as well as amounts deferred under the return on common equity sharing mechanism for the 2013/2014 Test Period to reduce the requested base rate increases. The order included provisions that require WPL to defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds certain levels in 2017 or 2018. WPL’s Wisconsin Retail Electric and Gas Rate Case (2015/2016 Test Period) - In July 2014, WPL received an order from the PSCW authorizing WPL to maintain retail electric base rates at their then current levels through the end of 2016. The retail electric base rate case included a return of and return of costs for environmental controls projects, generation performance and reliability improvements, other ongoing capital expenditures and an increase in electric transmission service expense. The additional revenue requirement for these cost increases was offset by the impact of changes in the amortization of regulatory liabilities associated with energy efficiency recoveries and increased sales volumes. The order also authorized WPL to implement a $5 million decrease in annual base rates for its retail gas customers effective January 1, 2015 followed by a freeze of such gas base rates through the end of 2016. The order included provisions that required WPL to defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeded certain levels in 2015 or 2016. As of December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy and WPL deferred $6 million of WPL’s 2016 earnings for these provisions, which is included in “Other” in Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s regulatory liabilities tables above. WPL’s Wisconsin Retail Electric and Gas Rate Case (2013/2014 Test Period) - The PSCW’s order for WPL’s 2013/2014 Test Period electric and gas base rate case included provisions that required WPL to defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeded certain levels during 2013 or 2014. As of December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy and WPL deferred $6 million of WPL’s 2013 and 2014 earnings for these provisions, which is included in “Other” in Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s regulatory liabilities tables above. These deferred earnings will be returned to customers as an offset to revenue requirements in 2017 and 2018 as authorized by the PSCW. IPL’s Iowa Retail Electric Rate Settlement Agreement - The IUB approved a settlement agreement in 2014 related to rates charged to IPL’s Iowa retail electric customers. The settlement agreement extended IPL’s Iowa retail electric base rates authorized in its 2009 Test Year rate case through 2016 and provided targeted retail electric customer billing credits of $105 million in aggregate. IPL recorded such billing credits as follows (in millions): WPL’s Retail Fuel-related Rate Filings - The PSCW authorized annual retail electric rate increases for WPL in 2014, 2015 and 2016, resulting from anticipated increases in retail electric fuel-related costs during such periods. Retail fuel-related costs incurred by WPL in 2015 and 2016 were lower than fuel-related costs used to determine rates for such period resulting in an over-collection of fuel-related costs, and retail fuel-related costs incurred by WPL in 2014 were higher than fuel-related costs used to determine rates for such period resulting in an under-collection of fuel-related costs. These fuel-related costs were subject to deferral since they were outside an annual bandwidth of plus or minus 2% of the approved respective annual forecasted fuel-related costs. Details on these rate increases, as well as amounts WPL deferred for the over-collected (included in “Commodity cost recovery” regulatory liabilities) or under-collected (included in “Commodity cost recovery” regulatory assets) fuel-related costs from its retail electric customers are as follows (dollars in millions): NOTE 3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT At December 31, details of property, plant and equipment on the balance sheets were as follows (in millions): (a) In 2016, IPL received approval from MISO to retire Sutherland Unit 3 and currently anticipates retiring this EGU by June 30, 2017. The recovery of the remaining net book value of this EGU is expected to be addressed in IPL’s next retail electric base rate case, which is currently expected to be filed in the second quarter of 2017. (b) Less accumulated amortization of $71.4 million and $65.2 million for WPL as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility is eliminated from WPL upon consolidation and is included in the “Non-regulated Generation, net” line within Alliant Energy’s consolidated property, plant and equipment. (c) Less accumulated depreciation of $46.5 million and $59.0 million for Alliant Energy as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (d) Less accumulated depreciation of $272.0 million and $252.9 million for Alliant Energy as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Utility - Environmental Controls Project - WPL’s Edgewater Unit 5 - Construction of a scrubber and baghouse at Edgewater Unit 5 began in 2014 and was completed in 2016, which resulted in a transfer of the capitalized project costs from “Construction work in progress” to “Electric plant - Generation in service” in the above table for Alliant Energy and WPL in 2016. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the capitalized project costs for the scrubber and baghouse consisted of capitalized expenditures of $225 million and CWIP of $190 million, and AFUDC of $12 million and $8 million, respectively, for the scrubber and baghouse. The scrubber and baghouse reduce SO2 and mercury emissions at the EGU and are expected to help meet requirements under CSAPR. Natural Gas-Fired Generation Projects - IPL’s Marshalltown Generating Station - IPL is currently constructing Marshalltown, an approximate 650 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle EGU. Construction began in 2014 and is expected to be completed in April 2017. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Alliant Energy and IPL recorded capitalized expenditures for CWIP of $612 million and $453 million, and AFUDC of $68 million and $24 million, respectively, for Marshalltown in “Construction work in progress” in the above table for Alliant Energy and IPL. WPL’s Riverside Expansion - WPL is currently constructing the Riverside expansion, an approximate 730 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle EGU. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed in early 2020. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Alliant Energy and WPL recorded capitalized expenditures for CWIP of $81 million and $2 million, and AFUDC of $2 million and $0, respectively, for the Riverside expansion in “Construction work in progress” in the above table for Alliant Energy and WPL. These capital expenditures exclude any potential impacts from the intent to exercise purchase options by certain WPL electric cooperatives for a partial ownership interest in the Riverside expansion. Wind Generation - IPL’s Expansion of Wind Generation - IPL currently plans to add wind generation to its resources portfolio. In 2016, IPL entered into a turbine supply agreement and made progress payments for a portion of the wind turbines in such agreement in order to qualify for the full level of production tax credits for this new wind generation. IPL anticipates placing certain of the additional wind generation in service in 2019 and 2020. As of December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy and IPL recorded capitalized expenditures for CWIP of $102 million and AFUDC of $1 million for this expansion of wind generation in “Construction work in progress” in the above table for Alliant Energy and IPL. Sales of IPL’s Minnesota Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Assets - In 2015, IPL completed the sale of its Minnesota natural gas distribution assets (primarily related to property, plant and equipment) and received proceeds of $11 million and a promissory note of $2 million. In 2015, IPL completed the sale of its Minnesota electric distribution assets (primarily related to property, plant and equipment) to Southern Minnesota Energy Cooperative, a combined group of various neighboring electric cooperatives, and received proceeds of $129 million. The proceeds from the natural gas distribution assets were used for general corporate purposes and the proceeds from the electric distribution assets were used to reduce cash amounts received from IPL’s sales of accounts receivable program. The premium received over the book value of the property, plant and equipment sold was more than offset by a reduction in tax-related regulatory assets associated with the distribution assets. As a result, Alliant Energy and IPL recorded pre-tax charges of $11 million and $3 million for the Minnesota electric and natural gas distribution asset transactions, respectively, in “Other operation and maintenance” in their income statements in 2015. The electric distribution asset sales agreement includes a wholesale power supply agreement between IPL and Southern Minnesota Energy Cooperative, which was approved by FERC in 2015 and became effective upon the sale of IPL’s Minnesota electric distribution assets. The wholesale power supply agreement contains a five-year termination notice, which may not be given until the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, resulting in a minimum term of 10 years. The agreement remains in effect indefinitely, unless notice to terminate is provided by either party. This wholesale power supply agreement includes standardized pricing mechanisms that are detailed in IPL’s current tariffs accepted by FERC through wholesale rate case proceedings. IPL’s current return on common equity authorized by FERC related to its wholesale electric rates is 10.97%. As a result of IPL’s requirement to supply electricity to Southern Minnesota Energy Cooperative under the wholesale power supply agreement, the sale of the electric distribution assets did not have a significant impact on IPL’s generation plans or operating results. AFUDC - AFUDC represents costs to finance construction additions including a return on equity component and cost of debt component as required by regulatory accounting. The concurrent credit for the amount of AFUDC capitalized is recorded as “Allowance for funds used during construction” in the income statements. The amount of AFUDC generated by equity and debt components was as follows (in millions): AFUDC related to various construction projects was recognized in the income statements as follows (in millions): Non-regulated and Other - The non-regulated and other property, plant and equipment recorded on Alliant Energy’s balance sheets includes the following: Non-regulated Generation - Franklin County Wind Farm - The Franklin County wind farm was placed into service in 2012 and is depreciated using the straight-line method over a 30-year period. Based on an evaluation of the strategic options for the Franklin County wind farm performed in 2016, Alliant Energy concluded it was probable the Franklin County wind farm will be transferred to IPL. As a result, Alliant Energy performed an impairment analysis of such assets in 2016. The impairment analysis evaluated the value of the assets and a reasonable estimate of the amount of costs associated with the Franklin County wind farm that would be allowed for recovery for IPL’s electric rate-making purposes. Based on various analyses, including discounted cash flows projected from the Franklin County wind farm, recently executed PPAs associated with wind generating facilities located near the Franklin County wind farm, and the cost of new wind farms identified through IPL’s planned wind expansion, the value of the Franklin County wind farm assets was determined to be approximately $33 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Alliant Energy concluded such value represents a reasonable estimate of the amount IPL will be allowed for recovery for IPL’s electric rate-making purposes. As a result, in 2016, the carrying amount of the Franklin County wind farm was reduced to such value, resulting in non-cash, pre-tax asset valuation charges of $86 million (after-tax charges of $51 million, or $0.23 per share). In 2016, Alliant Energy recorded such charges as a reduction to “Non-regulated Generation, net” in the above table and charges to “Asset valuation charges for Franklin County wind farm” in its income statement. In February 2017, FERC issued an order approving the transfer of the Franklin County wind farm from AEF to IPL. Alliant Energy and IPL currently expect to complete this transfer in 2017. The final amount to be recovered for IPL’s electric rate-making purposes is expected to be determined by the IUB as part of IPL’s retail electric rate case for the 2016 Test Year, currently anticipated to be filed in the second quarter of 2017, and therefore the final asset valuation charges are subject to change. Sheboygan Falls - Sheboygan Falls was placed into service in 2005 and is depreciated using the straight-line method over a 35-year period. As of December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy recorded $95 million on its balance sheet related to Sheboygan Falls. Corporate Services and Other - Property, plant and equipment related to Corporate Services includes a customer billing and information system for IPL and WPL and other computer software, and the corporate headquarters building located in Madison, Wisconsin. The customer billing and information system is amortized using the straight-line method over a 12-year period. The majority of the remaining software is amortized over a 5-year period. Property, plant and equipment related to Transportation includes a short-line railway in Iowa and a barge terminal on the Mississippi River. The Corporate Services and Other property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over periods ranging from 5 to 30 years. NOTE 4. JOINTLY-OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITY PLANT Under joint ownership agreements with other utilities, IPL and WPL have undivided ownership interests in jointly-owned coal-fired EGUs. Each of the respective owners is responsible for the financing of its portion of the construction costs. KWh generation and operating expenses are primarily divided between the joint owners on the same basis as ownership. IPL’s and WPL’s shares of expenses from jointly-owned coal-fired EGUs are included in the corresponding operating expenses (e.g., electric production fuel, other operation and maintenance, etc.) in their income statements. Information relative to IPL’s and WPL’s ownership interest in these jointly-owned coal-fired EGUs at December 31, 2016 was as follows (dollars in millions): In November 2016, WPL received an order from the PSCW approving amendments to the Columbia joint operating agreement, which allow the co-owners to forgo certain capital expenditures at Columbia (excluding capital expenditures related to the Columbia Unit 2 SCR currently being constructed), resulting in WPL incurring these additional capital expenditures in exchange for a proportional increase in its ownership share of Columbia. Based on the additional capital expenditures WPL currently expects to incur through June 1, 2020, WPL’s ownership interest in Columbia is expected to increase in the future. In December 2016, WPL filed a request with FERC for approval of these amendments to the Columbia joint operating agreement, effective January 1, 2017. WPL currently expects to receive FERC’s decision on these amendments in 2017. In November 2016, various electric cooperatives, which currently have wholesale power supply agreements with WPL, notified WPL of their intent to exercise purchase options for a partial ownership interest in the Riverside expansion. WPL currently expects the exercise of the purchase options to be effective in 2017. NOTE 5. RECEIVABLES NOTE 5(a) Accounts Receivable - Details for accounts receivable included on the balance sheets as of December 31 were as follows (in millions): NOTE 5(b) Sales of Accounts Receivable - IPL maintains a Receivables Agreement whereby it may sell its customer accounts receivables, unbilled revenues and certain other accounts receivables to a third party through wholly-owned and consolidated special purpose entities. IPL pays a monthly fee to the third party that varies based on interest rates, limits on cash proceeds and cash amounts received from the third party. In March 2016, IPL extended through March 2018 the purchase commitment from the third party to which it sells its receivables. The transfers of receivables meet the criteria for sale accounting established by the transfer of financial assets accounting rules. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, IPL received cash proceeds of up to $180 million from the third party in exchange for the receivables sold. Cash proceeds are used by IPL to meet short-term financing needs, and cannot exceed the current limit or amount of receivables available for sale, whichever is less. The limit on cash proceeds as of December 31, 2016 was $150 million, and effective February 2017 the limit on cash proceeds is $125 million. The Receivables Agreement can be terminated by the third party if arrears or write-offs exceed certain levels. IPL was in compliance with all related covenants as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, IPL sold $248.1 million of receivables to the third party, received $21.0 million in cash proceeds and recorded deferred proceeds of $211.1 million. Deferred proceeds represent IPL’s interest in the receivables sold to the third party. At IPL’s request, deferred proceeds are paid to IPL from collections of receivables, after paying any required expenses incurred by the third party and the collection agent. Corporate Services acts as collection agent for the third party and receives a fee for collection services. IPL believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts related to its sales of receivables is a reasonable approximation of credit risk of the customers that generated the receivables. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, IPL’s costs incurred related to the sales of accounts receivable program were not material. Refer to Note 14 for discussion of the fair value of deferred proceeds. IPL’s maximum and average outstanding aggregate cash proceeds (based on daily outstanding balances) related to the sales of accounts receivable program were as follows (in millions): As of December 31, the attributes of IPL’s receivables sold under the Receivables Agreement were as follows (in millions): (a) Changes in cash proceeds are presented in “Sales of accounts receivable” in operating activities in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s cash flows statements. Additional attributes of IPL’s receivables sold under the Receivables Agreement were as follows (in millions): In connection with the implementation of IPL’s new customer billing and information system in 2016, IPL postponed the write-off of customer bills for a portion of 2016, resulting in lower write-offs in 2016 and higher outstanding receivables past due as of December 31, 2016. NOTE 5(c) Whiting Petroleum Tax Sharing Agreement - Prior to an initial public offering of Whiting Petroleum in 2003, Alliant Energy and Whiting Petroleum entered into a tax separation and indemnification agreement pursuant to which Alliant Energy and Whiting Petroleum made certain tax elections. These tax elections had the effect of increasing the tax basis of the assets of Whiting Petroleum’s consolidated tax group based on the sales price of Whiting Petroleum’s shares in the initial public offering. The increase in the tax basis of the assets was included as income in Alliant Energy’s U.S. federal income tax return for the calendar year 2003. Pursuant to the tax separation and indemnification agreement, Whiting Petroleum paid Alliant Energy the final payment of $26 million in 2014, which represented the present value of certain future tax benefits expected to be realized by Whiting Petroleum through future tax deductions. The $26 million received by Alliant Energy is presented in operating activities in its cash flows statement in 2014. NOTE 6. INVESTMENTS NOTE 6(a) Unconsolidated Equity Investments - Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s unconsolidated investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting are as follows (in millions): (a) Alliant Energy currently has the ability to exercise significant influence over ATC’s financial and operating policies through its participation on ATC’s Board of Directors. Refer to Note 18 for information regarding related party transactions with ATC. Summary aggregate financial information from the financial statements of these investments is as follows (in millions): MISO Transmission Owner Return on Equity Complaints - A group of MISO cooperative and municipal utilities previously filed two complaints with FERC requesting a reduction of the base return on equity used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC. In September 2016, FERC issued an order on the first complaint to reduce the base return on equity for the refund period from November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015. In June 2016, a FERC administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the second complaint recommending a reduction of the base return on equity for the refund period from February 12, 2015 through May 11, 2016. A final decision on the second complaint from FERC is currently expected in the first half of 2017. Alliant Energy and WPL have realized a cumulative $24 million of reductions in the amount of equity income from ATC as a result of the two complaints through December 31, 2016, including $9 million, $12 million and $3 million realized in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. WPL’s Noncontrolling Interest and Investment in ATC - Prior to 2014, WPL owned 100% of WPL Transco, which held Alliant Energy’s investment in ATC. In 2014, WPL Transco’s operating agreement was amended to allow ATI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF, to become a member of WPL Transco in addition to WPL. In 2014, ATI began funding capital contributions that WPL Transco made to ATC. WPL Transco’s equity income from ATC and ATC dividends received by WPL Transco were allocated between WPL and ATI based on their respective ownership interests at the time the equity income was generated and at the time of the dividend payments. Prior to the transfer of the investment in ATC to ATI discussed below, WPL consolidated WPL Transco, and ATI’s ownership in WPL Transco was recorded as a noncontrolling interest in total equity on WPL’s balance sheets. In June 2016, WPL received an order from the PSCW requiring WPL to transfer its investment in ATC to Alliant Energy or an Alliant Energy subsidiary by December 31, 2022. On December 31, 2016, pursuant to the PSCW order, WPL Transco was liquidated and WPL transferred its investment in ATC to ATI. In conjunction with the transfer of the investment in ATC, a deferred intercompany tax gain recognized by WPL was assumed by ATI. The impact of WPL’s transfer of the ATC investment, including the assumption of such intercompany tax gain by ATI, was recorded as a net reduction in total equity of $163.6 million on WPL’s balance sheet. WPL’s income statement includes all of the equity earnings from ATC through December 31, 2016, the date of transfer. There were no impacts of this transfer to Alliant Energy’s consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, ATI owns Alliant Energy’s entire investment in ATC. NOTE 6(b) Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Policies - Various life insurance policies cover certain current and former employees and directors. In 2016, certain of Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s company-owned life insurance policies were liquidated. The related proceeds of $31 million and $19 million were recorded in investing activities in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s cash flow statements, respectively. At December 31, the cash surrender value of these investments was as follows (in millions): NOTE 7. COMMON EQUITY Common Stock Split - On April 20, 2016, Alliant Energy’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one common stock split and a proportionate increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock of Alliant Energy from 240 million shares to 480 million shares to implement the stock split. Alliant Energy shareowners of record at the close of business on May 4, 2016 received one additional share of Alliant Energy common stock for each share held on that date. The proportionate interest that a shareowner owns in Alliant Energy did not change as a result of the stock split. The additional shares were distributed on May 19, 2016 and post-split trading began on May 20, 2016. All Alliant Energy share and per share amounts in this report have been reflected on a post-split basis. Common Share Activity - A summary of Alliant Energy’s common stock activity was as follows: At December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy had a total of 11.3 million shares available for issuance in the aggregate, pursuant to its Amended and Restated OIP, Shareowner Direct Plan and 401(k) Savings Plan. At-the-Market Offering Program - In 2015, Alliant Energy filed a prospectus supplement under which it may sell up to $150 million of its common stock through an at-the-market offering program. In 2015, Alliant Energy issued 4,373,234 shares of common stock through this program and received cash proceeds of $133 million, net of $2 million in fees and commissions. The proceeds from the issuances of common stock were used for general corporate purposes. This at-the-market offering program expired in 2016. Shareowner Direct Plan - Beginning in 2015, Alliant Energy satisfied its requirements under the Shareowner Direct Plan (dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan) by acquiring Alliant Energy common stock through original issue, rather than on the open market. Shareowner Rights Agreement - Alliant Energy has established an amended and restated Shareowner Rights Agreement. The rights under this agreement will only become exercisable if a person or group has acquired, or announced an intention to acquire, 15% or more of Alliant Energy’s outstanding common stock. Each right will initially entitle registered shareowners to purchase from Alliant Energy one-quarter of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock. The rights will be exercisable at an initial price of $55.00 per full share, subject to adjustment. If any shareowner acquires 15% or more of the outstanding common stock of Alliant Energy, each right (subject to limitations) will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right’s then current exercise price, a number of common shares of Alliant Energy or of the acquirer having a market value at the time of twice the right’s per full share exercise price. Alliant Energy’s Board of Directors is authorized to reduce the 15% ownership threshold to not less than 10%. The amended and restated Shareowner Rights Agreement expires in December 2018. Alliant Energy currently has no intention to redeem the Shareowner Rights Agreement and plans to allow it to naturally expire at the end of the term. Dividend Restrictions - Alliant Energy does not have any significant common stock dividend restrictions. IPL and WPL each have common stock dividend restrictions based on applicable regulatory limitations. IPL also has common stock dividend restrictions based on the terms of its outstanding preferred stock. As of December 31, 2016, IPL and WPL were in compliance with all such dividend restrictions. IPL is restricted from paying common stock dividends to its parent company, Alliant Energy, if for any past or current dividend period, dividends on its preferred stock have not been paid, or declared and set apart for payment. IPL has paid all dividends on its preferred stock through 2016. Under the Federal Power Act, IPL may not pay dividends to its parent company in excess of the current amount of its retained earnings. As of December 31, 2016, IPL’s amount of retained earnings that were free of dividend restrictions was $618 million. If IPL’s actual 13-month average common equity ratio (calculated on a financial basis consistent with IPL’s rate cases) falls below 42% of total capitalization, IPL is required to notify the IUB. Pursuant to a December 2016 PSCW order, WPL has a regulatory limitation on distributions to its parent company. WPL is prohibited from paying annual common stock dividends to its parent company in excess of forecasted dividend levels of $126 million in 2017 and $140 million in 2018 if WPL’s actual 13-month average common equity ratio (calculated on a financial basis consistent with WPL’s rate cases) would fall below 51.00% for 2017 or 2018. As of December 31, 2016, WPL’s amount of retained earnings that were free of dividend restrictions was $126 million for 2017. Restricted Net Assets of Subsidiaries - IPL and WPL do not have regulatory authority to lend or advance any amounts to their parent company. As of December 31, 2016, the amount of net assets of IPL and WPL that were not available to be transferred to their parent company, Alliant Energy, in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends without the consent of IPL’s and WPL’s regulatory authorities was $1.6 billion for each. Comprehensive Income - In 2016, 2015 and 2014, Alliant Energy’s other comprehensive income (loss) was $0, $0.2 million and ($0.4) million, respectively; therefore, its comprehensive income was substantially equal to its net income and its comprehensive income attributable to Alliant Energy common shareowners was substantially equal to its net income attributable to Alliant Energy common shareowners for such periods. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, IPL and WPL had no other comprehensive income; therefore their comprehensive income was equal to their net income and their comprehensive income available for common stock was equal to their earnings available for common stock for such periods. NOTE 8. REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK IPL is authorized to issue up to 16,000,000 shares of cumulative preferred stock in aggregate. Information related to the carrying value of IPL’s cumulative preferred stock at December 31 was as follows: On or after March 15, 2018, IPL may, at its option, redeem the 5.1% cumulative preferred stock for cash at a redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the redemption date. The current articles of incorporation of IPL contain a provision that grants the holders of its cumulative preferred stock voting rights to elect two members of IPL’s Board of Directors if preferred dividends equal to six or more quarterly dividend requirements (whether or not consecutive) are in arrears. Such voting rights would not provide the holders of IPL’s preferred stock control of the decision on redemption of IPL’s preferred stock and could not force IPL to exercise its call option. Therefore, IPL’s cumulative preferred stock is presented in total equity on Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s balance sheets in a manner consistent with noncontrolling interests. Refer to Note 14 for information on the fair value of cumulative preferred stock. NOTE 9. DEBT NOTE 9(a) Short-term Debt - Alliant Energy and its subsidiaries maintain committed bank lines of credit to provide short-term borrowing flexibility and back-stop liquidity for commercial paper outstanding. At December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy’s short-term borrowing arrangements included three revolving credit facilities totaling $1 billion ($300 million for Alliant Energy at the parent company level, $300 million for IPL and $400 million for WPL), which expire in December 2018. Information regarding commercial paper classified as short-term debt and back-stopped by the credit facilities was as follows (dollars in millions): Financial Covenants - The credit facility agreements and AEF’s term loan credit agreement each contain a financial covenant, which requires Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL to maintain certain debt-to-capital ratios in order to borrow under the credit facilities and term loan credit agreement. The required debt-to-capital ratios compared to the actual debt-to-capital ratios at December 31, 2016 were as follows: The debt component of the capital ratios includes long- and short-term debt (excluding non-recourse debt and hybrid securities to the extent the total carrying value of such hybrid securities does not exceed 15% of consolidated capital of the applicable borrower), capital lease obligations, certain letters of credit, guarantees of the foregoing and new synthetic leases. Unfunded vested benefits under qualified pension plans and sales of accounts receivable are not included in the debt-to-capital ratios. The equity component of the capital ratios excludes accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). NOTE 9(b) Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt, net as of December 31 was as follows (dollars in millions): (a) Contains optional redemption provisions which, if elected by the issuer at its sole discretion, could require material redemption premium payments by the issuer. The redemption premium payments under these optional redemption provisions are variable and dependent on applicable U.S. Treasury rates at the time of redemption. (b) In 2016, IPL issued $300 million of 3.7% senior debentures due 2046. The proceeds from the issuance were used by IPL to reduce cash amounts received from its sales of accounts receivable program, reduce commercial paper classified as long-term debt by $100 million and for general corporate purposes. (c) In 2016, AEF entered into a $500 million variable-rate term loan credit agreement and used the proceeds from borrowings under this agreement to retire Alliant Energy’s and Franklin County Holdings LLC’s variable-rate term loan credit agreements that matured in 2016, reduce outstanding commercial paper at Alliant Energy and for general corporate purposes. (d) Refer to Note 9(a) for discussion of a financial covenant contained in AEF’s term loan credit agreement. (e) There were no significant sinking fund requirements related to the outstanding long-term debt. Five-Year Schedule of Debt Maturities - At December 31, 2016, debt maturities for 2017 through 2021 were as follows (in millions): Fair Value of Long-term Debt - Refer to Note 14 for information on the fair value of long-term debt outstanding. NOTE 10. LEASES NOTE 10(a) Operating Leases - Various agreements have been entered into related to property, plant and equipment rights that are accounted for as operating leases. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, rental expenses associated with operating leases were not material. At December 31, 2016, future minimum operating lease payments, excluding contingent rentals, were as follows (in millions): NOTE 10(b) Capital Leases - WPL - In 2005, WPL entered into a 20-year agreement with AEF’s Non-regulated Generation business to lease Sheboygan Falls, with an option for two lease renewal periods thereafter. The lease became effective in 2005 when Sheboygan Falls began commercial operation. WPL is responsible for the operation of Sheboygan Falls and has exclusive rights to its output, and the PSCW approved this affiliated lease agreement in 2005. The capital lease asset is amortized using the straight-line method over the 20-year lease term. WPL’s retail and wholesale rates include recovery of the Sheboygan Falls lease payments. Sheboygan Falls lease expenses were included in WPL’s income statements as follows (in millions): At December 31, 2016, WPL’s estimated future minimum capital lease payments for Sheboygan Falls were as follows (in millions): NOTE 11. INCOME TAXES Income Tax Expense (Benefit) - The components of “Income tax expense (benefit)” in the income statements were as follows (in millions): Income Tax Rates - The overall income tax rates shown in the following table were computed by dividing income tax expense (benefit) by income from continuing operations before income taxes. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities - The deferred tax assets and liabilities included on the balance sheets at December 31 arise from the following temporary differences (in millions): Property - Property-related differences were primarily related to accelerated depreciation, including bonus depreciation. In 2015, the PATH Act was enacted. The most significant provisions of the PATH Act for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL relate to the extension of bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures for property incurred through December 31, 2019 and placed in service prior to December 31, 2020. Alliant Energy currently estimates its total bonus depreciation deductions to be claimed on its U.S. federal income tax return for calendar year 2016 will be approximately $350 million ($100 million for IPL and $200 million for WPL). Carryforwards - At December 31, 2016, carryforwards and expiration dates were estimated as follows (in millions): Uncertain Tax Positions - At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no uncertain tax positions or penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions, and interest accrued and tax positions favorably impacting future effective tax rates for continuing operations were not material. As of December 31, 2016, no material changes to unrecognized tax benefits are expected during the next 12 months. Open tax years - Tax years that remain subject to the statute of limitations in the major jurisdictions for each of Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are as follows: (a) The federal tax returns for 2013 and 2014 are effectively settled as a result of participation in the IRS Compliance Assurance Program, which allows Alliant Energy and the IRS to work together to resolve issues related to Alliant Energy’s current tax year before filing its federal income tax return. The statute of limitations for these federal tax returns expires three years from each filing date. (b) The statute of limitations for these Iowa tax returns expires three years from each filing date. (c) The statute of limitations for these Wisconsin combined tax returns expires four years from each filing date. NOTE 12. BENEFIT PLANS NOTE 12(a) Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans - Retirement benefits are provided to substantially all employees through various qualified and non-qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plans (currently closed to new hires), and/or through defined contribution plans (including 401(k) savings plans). Benefits of the non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are based on the plan participant’s years of service, age and compensation. Benefits of the defined contribution plans are based on the plan participant’s years of service, age, compensation and contributions. Certain defined benefit postretirement health care and life benefits are provided to eligible retirees. In general, the retiree health care plans consist of fixed benefit subsidy structures and the retiree life insurance plans are non-contributory. IPL and WPL account for their participation in Alliant Energy and Corporate Services sponsored plans as multiple-employer plans. In IPL’s and WPL’s tables below, the defined benefit pension plans amounts represent those respective amounts for their bargaining unit employees covered under the qualified plans that they sponsor, as well as amounts directly assigned to them related to their current and former non-bargaining employees who are participants in the Alliant Energy and Corporate Services sponsored qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. In IPL’s and WPL’s tables below, the OPEB plans amounts represent respective amounts for their employees, as well as amounts directly assigned to them related to their current and former non-bargaining employees who are participants in the Corporate Services sponsored OPEB plan. Assumptions - The assumptions for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans at the measurement date of December 31 were as follows: Expected rate of return on plan assets - The expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by analysis of projected asset class returns based on the target asset class allocations. A forward-looking building blocks approach is used, and historical returns, survey information and capital market information are reviewed to support the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption. Refer to “Investment Policy and Strategy for Plan Assets” below for additional information related to investment policy, and strategy and mix of assets for the pension and OPEB plans. Life Expectancy - The life expectancy assumption is used in determining the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. This assumption was updated to utilize mortality tables that were released in 2014 by the Society of Actuaries and updated in 2015 and 2016. Net Periodic Benefit Costs (Credits) - The components of net periodic benefit costs (credits) for sponsored defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are included in the tables below (in millions). Net periodic benefit costs are primarily included in “Other operation and maintenance” in the income statements. (a) The expected return on plan assets is based on the expected rate of return on plan assets and the fair value approach to the market-related value of plan assets. (b) Unrecognized prior service costs (credits) for the OPEB plans are amortized over the average future service period to full eligibility of the participants of each plan. (c) Unrecognized net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the plans’ benefit obligations or assets are amortized over the average future service lives of plan participants, except for the Alliant Energy Cash Balance Pension Plan where gains or losses outside the 10% threshold are amortized over the time period the participants are expected to receive benefits. The estimated amortization from “Regulatory assets” and “Regulatory liabilities” on the balance sheets and AOCL on Alliant Energy’s balance sheet into net periodic benefit cost in 2017 is as follows (in millions): Benefit Plan Assets and Obligations - A reconciliation of the funded status of Alliant Energy’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and OPEB plans to the amounts recognized on Alliant Energy’s balance sheets at December 31 was as follows (in millions): A reconciliation of the funded status of IPL’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and OPEB plans to the amounts recognized on IPL’s balance sheets at December 31 was as follows (in millions): A reconciliation of the funded status of WPL’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and OPEB plans to the amounts recognized on WPL’s balance sheets at December 31 was as follows (in millions): Included in the following tables are accumulated benefit obligations, aggregate amounts applicable to defined benefit pension and OPEB plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, as well as defined benefit pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of the December 31 measurement date (in millions): In addition to the amounts recognized in regulatory assets in the above tables for IPL and WPL, regulatory assets were recognized for amounts associated with Corporate Services employees participating in other Alliant Energy sponsored benefit plans that were allocated to IPL and WPL at December 31 as follows (in millions): Estimated Future Employer Contributions and Benefit Payments - Estimated funding for the qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and OPEB plans for 2017 is as follows (in millions): (a) Alliant Energy sponsors several non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover certain current and former key employees of IPL and WPL. Alliant Energy allocates pension costs to IPL and WPL for these plans. In addition, IPL and WPL amounts reflect funding for their non-bargaining employees who are participants in the Alliant Energy and Corporate Services sponsored qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. Expected benefit payments for the qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows (in millions): Investment Policy and Strategy for Plan Assets - Investment policies and strategies employed with respect to assets of defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are to combine both preservation of principal and prudent and reasonable risk-taking to protect the integrity of plan assets, in order to meet the obligations to plan participants while minimizing benefit costs over the long term. It is recognized that risk and volatility are present with all types of investments. However, risk is mitigated at the total fund level through diversification by asset class including U.S. and international equity and fixed income exposure, global asset and risk parity strategies, the number of individual investments, and sector and industry limits. Global asset and risk parity strategies include investments in global equity, global debt, commodities and currencies. Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets - For assets of defined benefit pension plans, the mix among asset classes is controlled by asset allocation targets. Historical performance results and future expectations suggest that equity securities will provide higher total investment returns than debt securities over a long-term investment horizon. Consistent with the goals of meeting obligations to plan participants and minimizing benefit costs over the long-term, the defined benefit pension plans have a long-term investment posture more heavily weighted towards equity holdings. The asset allocation is monitored regularly and appropriate steps are taken as needed to rebalance the assets within the prescribed ranges. An overlay management service is also used to help maintain target allocations and meet liquidity needs. The overlay manager is authorized to use derivative financial instruments to facilitate this service. For separately managed accounts, prohibited investment vehicles include, but may not be limited to, direct ownership of real estate, margin trading, oil and gas limited partnerships and securities of the managers’ firms or affiliate firms. At December 31, 2016, the current target ranges and actual allocations for the defined benefit pension plan assets were as follows: Other Postretirement Benefits Plan Assets - OPEB plan assets are comprised of specific assets within certain defined benefit pension plans (401(h) assets) as well as assets held in VEBA trusts. The investment policy and strategy of the 401(h) assets, except for the WPL 401(h) assets, mirrors those of the defined benefit pension plans, which are discussed above. For VEBA trusts with assets greater than $5 million and the WPL 401(h) assets, the mix among asset classes is controlled by allocation targets. The asset allocation is monitored regularly and appropriate steps are taken as needed to rebalance the assets within the prescribed ranges. Mutual funds are used to achieve the desired diversification. At December 31, 2016, the current target ranges and actual allocations for VEBA trusts with assets greater than $5 million and the WPL 401(h) assets were as follows: Fair Value Measurements - Fair value measurement accounting establishes three levels of fair value hierarchy that prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Refer to Note 14 for discussion of levels within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 items include investments in securities held in registered investment companies, treasury bills and directly held equity securities, which are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the securities are traded. Level 2 items include fixed income securities consisting of corporate and government bonds and agency obligations, which are valued at the closing price reported in the active market for similar assets in which the individual securities are traded or based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. These fair value amounts are included in the tables below to reconcile the fair value hierarchy to the respective total plan assets. At December 31, the fair values of Alliant Energy’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plan assets were as follows (in millions): At December 31, the fair values of IPL’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plan assets were as follows (in millions): At December 31, the fair values of WPL’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plan assets were as follows (in millions): At December 31, the fair values of Alliant Energy’s OPEB plan assets were as follows (in millions): At December 31, the fair values of IPL’s OPEB plan assets were as follows (in millions): At December 31, the fair values of WPL’s OPEB plan assets were as follows (in millions): For the various defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, Alliant Energy common stock represented less than 1% of assets directly held in the plans at December 31, 2016 and 2015. 401(k) Savings Plans - A significant number of employees participate in defined contribution retirement plans (401(k) savings plans). Alliant Energy common stock directly held by participants represented 12.6% and 11.6% of total assets in the 401(k) savings plans at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Costs related to the 401(k) savings plans, which are partially based on the participants’ contributions and include allocated costs associated with Corporate Services employees for IPL and WPL, were as follows (in millions): Voluntary Employee Separation Charges - In 2015, Alliant Energy offered certain employees a voluntary separation package. Approximately 2% of total Alliant Energy employees accepted this package, which resulted in Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL recording charges of $8 million, $5 million and $3 million, respectively, in 2015. NOTE 12(b) Equity-based Compensation Plans - All shares, units and awards included below have been adjusted to reflect the common stock split discussed in Note 7. In 2015, Alliant Energy’s shareowners approved the Amended and Restated OIP, which permits the grant of shares of Alliant Energy common stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and other stock-based or cash-based awards to key employees. At December 31, 2016, performance shares, performance-contingent restricted stock and restricted stock units (performance- and time-based) were outstanding under the Amended and Restated OIP, and 7.4 million shares of Alliant Energy’s common stock remained available for grants under the Amended and Restated OIP. Alliant Energy satisfies share payouts related to equity awards under the Amended and Restated OIP through the issuance of new shares of its common stock. Alliant Energy also has the DLIP, which permits the grant of cash-based long-term performance-based awards, including performance units, restricted cash awards and restricted units, to certain key employees. At December 31, 2016, performance units, performance-contingent cash awards and restricted units (performance- and time-based) were outstanding under the DLIP. There is no limit to the number of grants that can be made under the DLIP and Alliant Energy satisfies all payouts under the DLIP through cash payments. Nonvested awards generally do not have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents when dividends are paid to common shareowners. A summary of compensation expense, including amounts allocated to IPL and WPL, and the related income tax benefits recognized for share-based compensation awards was as follows (in millions): As of December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation awards was $5.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of between 1 and 2 years. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods and is primarily recorded in “Other operation and maintenance” in the income statements. Performance Shares and Performance Units - Payouts of performance shares under the Amended and Restated OIP and performance units under the DLIP to key employees are contingent upon achievement over three-year periods of specified performance criteria, which currently include metrics of total shareowner return relative to an investor-owned utility peer group. Performance shares can be paid out in shares of Alliant Energy’s common stock, cash or a combination of cash and stock. Performance units must be paid out in cash. Alliant Energy assumes it will make future payouts of its performance shares and performance units in cash; therefore, performance shares and performance units are accounted for as liability awards. A summary of the performance shares and performance units activity, with amounts representing the target number of awards, was as follows: Granted Awards - Each performance share’s value is based on the closing market price of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock at the end of the performance period. For performance units granted in 2016, the value is based on the closing market price of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock at the end of the performance period. For performance units granted in 2015 and 2014, each performance unit’s value is based on the closing market price of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock on the grant date of the award. The actual payout for performance shares and performance units is dependent upon actual performance and may range from zero to 200% of the target number of awards. Compensation expense for performance shares and performance units is recorded ratably over the performance period based on the fair value of the awards at each reporting period. Vested Awards - Certain performance shares and performance units vested, resulting in payouts (a combination of cash and common stock for the performance shares and cash only for the performance units) as follows: Fair Value of Awards - Information related to fair values of nonvested performance shares and performance units at December 31, 2016, by year of grant, were as follows: Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock - Vesting of performance-contingent restricted stock grants is based on the achievement of certain performance targets (currently specified growth of consolidated income from continuing operations). If performance targets are not met within the performance period, which currently ranges from two to four years, these restricted stock grants are forfeited. The fair value of performance-contingent restricted stock is based on the closing market price on the grant date. A summary of the performance-contingent restricted stock activity was as follows: (a) In 2015, 98,186 performance-contingent restricted shares granted in 2013 vested because the specified performance criteria for such shares were met. In 2014, 91,224 and 90,470 performance-contingent restricted shares granted in 2012 and 2011, respectively, vested because the specified performance criteria for such shares were met. (b) The forfeitures during 2014 were primarily caused by retirements and terminations of participants. Performance Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Units - Alliant Energy granted new types of share-based compensation awards to key employees in 2016 referred to as performance restricted stock units under the Amended and Restated OIP, and performance restricted units and key employee performance restricted units under the DLIP. Payouts of these units are based on the achievement of certain performance targets (currently specified growth of consolidated income from continuing operations) during a three-year performance period. The actual number of units that will be paid out upon vesting is dependent upon actual performance and may range from zero to 200% of the target number of units. If performance targets are not met during the performance period, these units are forfeited. As of December 31, 2016, the amount of nonvested performance restricted units and key employee performance restricted units was not material. Performance Restricted Stock Units - Performance restricted stock units generally must be paid out in shares and are accounted for as equity awards. Each performance restricted stock unit’s value is based on the closing market price of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock on the grant date of the award. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the performance period based on a probability assessment of payouts for the awards at each reporting period. A summary of the performance restricted stock units activity, with amounts representing the target number of units, was as follows: Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Units - Alliant Energy granted new types of share-based compensation awards to key employees in 2016 referred to as restricted stock units under the Amended and Restated OIP and restricted units under the DLIP. Payouts of these units are based on the expiration of a three-year time-vesting period. Each restricted stock unit’s value is based on the closing market price of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock at the end of the time-vesting period. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the performance period based on the fair value of the awards at each reporting period. Restricted stock units can be paid out in shares of Alliant Energy common stock, cash or a combination of cash and stock. Alliant Energy assumes it will make future payouts of its restricted stock units in cash; therefore, restricted stock units are accounted for as liability awards. As of December 31, 2016, the amount of nonvested restricted units was not material. A summary of the restricted stock units activity was as follows: Performance-Contingent Cash Awards - Performance-contingent cash award payouts to key employees are based on the achievement of certain performance targets (currently specified growth of consolidated income from continuing operations). If performance targets are not met within the performance period, which currently ranges from two to four years, there are no payouts for these awards. Each performance-contingent cash award’s value is based on the price of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock at the end of the performance period. Alliant Energy accounts for performance-contingent cash awards as liability awards because payouts will be made in the form of cash. A summary of the performance-contingent cash awards activity was as follows: (a) In 2015, 74,664 performance-contingent cash awards granted in 2013 vested, resulting in cash payouts valued at $2.4 million. In 2014, 69,532 and 41,502 performance-contingent cash awards granted in 2012 and 2011 vested, resulting in cash payouts valued at $1.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively. NOTE 12(c) Deferred Compensation Plan - Alliant Energy maintains a DCP under which key employees may defer up to 100% of base salary and short-term cash incentive compensation and directors may elect to defer all or part of their retainer and committee fees. Key employees who have made the maximum allowed contribution to the Alliant Energy 401(k) Savings Plan may receive an additional credit to the DCP. Key employees and directors may elect to have their deferrals credited to a company stock account, an interest account or equity accounts based on certain benchmark funds. Company Stock Accounts - The DCP does not permit diversification of deferrals credited to the company stock account and all distributions from participants’ company stock accounts are made in the form of shares of Alliant Energy common stock. The deferred compensation obligations for participants’ company stock accounts are recorded in “Additional paid-in capital” and the shares of Alliant Energy common stock held in a rabbi trust to satisfy this obligation are recorded in “Shares in deferred compensation trust” on Alliant Energy’s balance sheets. At December 31, the carrying value of the deferred compensation obligation for the company stock accounts and the shares in the deferred compensation trust based on the historical value of the shares of Alliant Energy common stock contributed to the rabbi trust, and the fair market value of the shares held in the rabbi trust were as follows (in millions): Interest and Equity Accounts - Distributions from participants’ interest and equity accounts are in the form of cash payments. The deferred compensation obligations for participants’ interest and equity accounts are recorded in “Pension and other benefit obligations” on Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s balance sheets. At December 31, the carrying value of deferred compensation obligations for participants’ interest and equity accounts, which approximates fair market value, was as follows (in millions): NOTE 13. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Recognized AROs relate to legal obligations for the removal, closure or dismantlement of several assets including, but not limited to, ash ponds, wind farms, active ash landfills, certain coal yards and above ground storage tanks. Recognized AROs also include legal obligations for the management and final disposition of asbestos, lead-based paint and polychlorinated biphenyls. AROs are recorded in “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on the balance sheets. Refer to Note 2 for information regarding regulatory assets related to AROs. A reconciliation of the changes in AROs associated with long-lived assets is as follows (in millions): (a) In April 2015, the EPA published the final CCR Rule, which regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste and was effective October 2015. IPL and WPL have nine and three coal-fired EGUs, respectively, with coal ash ponds that are impacted by this rule. In addition, IPL and WPL have four and two active CCR landfills, respectively, that are impacted by this rule. In 2015, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL recognized additional AROs of $87 million, $67 million and $20 million, respectively, as a result of the final CCR Rule. These increases in AROs resulted in corresponding increases in property, plant and equipment, net on the respective balance sheets. Actual costs resulting from the CCR Rule may be different than the amounts recorded in 2015 due to potential changes in compliance strategies that will be used, as well as other potential cost estimate changes. Expenditures incurred by IPL and WPL to comply with the CCR Rule are anticipated to be recovered in rates from their customers. In addition, certain AROs related to EGU assets have not been recognized. Due to an indeterminate remediation date, the fair values of the AROs for these assets cannot be currently estimated. A liability for these AROs will be recorded when fair value is determinable. Removal costs of these EGUs are being recovered in rates and are recorded in regulatory liabilities. NOTE 14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Valuation Hierarchy - Fair value measurement accounting establishes three levels of fair value hierarchy that prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1 pricing inputs are quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2 pricing inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active as of the reporting date. Level 3 pricing inputs are unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities for which little or no market data exist and require significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. Valuation Techniques - Derivative assets and derivative liabilities - Derivative instruments are used for risk management purposes to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in certain commodity prices, transmission congestion costs and rail transportation costs. Risk policies are maintained that govern the use of such derivative instruments. Derivative instruments were not designated as hedging instruments and included the following: Swap, option and physical forward commodity contracts were non-exchange-based derivative instruments and were valued using indicative price quotations from a pricing vendor that provides daily exchange forward price settlements, from broker or dealer quotations, from market publications or from on-line exchanges. The indicative price quotations reflected the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices and were obtained from sources believed to provide the most liquid market for the commodity. A portion of these indicative price quotations were corroborated using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and categorized derivative instruments based on such indicative price quotations as Level 2. Commodity contracts that were valued using indicative price quotations based on significant assumptions such as seasonal or monthly shaping and indicative price quotations that could not be readily corroborated were categorized as Level 3. Swap, option and physical forward commodity contracts were predominately at liquid trading points. FTRs were valued using auction prices and were categorized as Level 3. Refer to Note 15 for additional details of derivative assets and derivative liabilities. Deferred proceeds (sales of receivables) - The fair value of IPL’s deferred proceeds related to its sales of accounts receivable program was calculated each reporting date using the cost approach valuation technique. The fair value represents the carrying amount of receivables sold less the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with the receivables sold and cash amounts received from the receivables sold due to the short-term nature of the collection period. These inputs were considered unobservable and deferred proceeds were categorized as Level 3. Deferred proceeds represent IPL’s maximum exposure to loss related to the receivables sold. Refer to Note 5(b) for additional information regarding deferred proceeds. Long-term debt (including current maturities) - The fair value of long-term debt instruments was based on quoted market prices for similar liabilities at each reporting date or on a discounted cash flow methodology, which utilizes assumptions of current market pricing curves at each reporting date, and was substantially classified as Level 2. Refer to Note 9(b) for additional information regarding long-term debt. Cumulative preferred stock - The fair value of IPL’s 5.1% cumulative preferred stock was based on its closing market price quoted by the New York Stock Exchange at each reporting date, and was classified as Level 1. Refer to Note 8 for additional information regarding cumulative preferred stock. Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of such financial instruments. Carrying amounts and the related estimated fair values of other financial instruments at December 31 were as follows (in millions): Information for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) was as follows (in millions): (a) Settlements related to deferred proceeds are due to the change in the carrying amount of receivables sold less the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with the receivables sold and cash amounts received from the receivables sold. Commodity Contracts - The fair value of electric, natural gas and coal commodity contracts categorized as Level 3 was recognized as net derivative assets (liabilities) at December 31 as follows (in millions): NOTE 15. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Commodity Derivatives - Purpose - Derivative instruments are used for risk management purposes to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in certain commodity prices and transmission congestion costs. Refer to Note 14 for detailed discussion of derivative instruments. Notional Amounts - As of December 31, 2016, gross notional amounts and settlement/delivery years related to outstanding swap contracts, option contracts, physical forward contracts, FTRs, coal contracts and diesel fuel contracts that were accounted for as commodity derivative instruments were as follows (units in thousands): Financial Statement Presentation - Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value each reporting date on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities. At December 31, the fair values of current derivative assets are included in “Other current assets,” non-current derivative assets are included in “Deferred charges and other,” current derivative liabilities are included in “Other current liabilities” and non-current derivative liabilities are included in “Other liabilities” on the balance sheets as follows (in millions): Unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments are generally recorded with offsets to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities, based on fuel and natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, as well as other specific regulatory authorizations. Based on these recovery mechanisms, the changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities resulted in comparable changes to regulatory assets, and the changes in the fair value of derivative assets resulted in comparable changes to regulatory liabilities. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion. Credit Risk-related Contingent Features - Various agreements contain credit risk-related contingent features, including requirements to maintain certain credit ratings and/or limitations on liability positions under the agreements based on credit ratings. Certain of these agreements with credit risk-related contingency features are accounted for as derivative instruments. In the event of a material change in creditworthiness or if liability positions exceed certain contractual limits, credit support may need to be provided in the form of letters of credit or cash collateral up to the amount of exposure under the contracts, or the contracts may need to be unwound and underlying liability positions paid. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was not materially different than amounts that would be required to be posted as credit support to counterparties by Alliant Energy, IPL or WPL if the most restrictive credit risk-related contingent features for derivative agreements in a net liability position were triggered. Balance Sheet Offsetting - The fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to a master netting arrangement are not netted by counterparty on the balance sheets. However, if the fair value amounts of derivative instruments by counterparty were netted, amounts would not be materially different from gross amounts of derivative assets and derivative liabilities at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (payable) are not offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES NOTE 16(a) Capital Purchase Obligations - Various contractual obligations contain minimum future commitments related to capital expenditures for certain construction projects. IPL’s projects include the installation of an SCR system at Ottumwa Unit 1 to reduce NOx emissions at the EGU. WPL’s projects include the Riverside expansion, generation maintenance and performance improvements at Columbia Units 1 and 2, and the installation of an SCR system at Columbia Unit 2 to reduce NOx emissions at the EGU. At December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s minimum future commitments related to certain contractual obligations for these projects were $58 million, $3 million and $55 million, respectively. NOTE 16(b) Operating Expense Purchase Obligations - Various commodity supply, transportation and storage contracts help meet obligations to provide electricity and natural gas to utility customers. Other operating expense purchase obligations with various vendors provide other goods and services. At December 31, 2016, minimum future commitments related to these operating expense purchase obligations were as follows (in millions): (a) Includes payments required by PPAs for capacity rights and minimum quantities of MWhs required to be purchased. (b) Corporate Services entered into system-wide coal contracts on behalf of IPL and WPL that include minimum future commitments. These commitments were assigned to IPL and WPL based on information available as of December 31, 2016 regarding expected future usage, which is subject to change. (c) Includes individual commitments incurred during the normal course of business that exceeded $1 million at December 31, 2016. Certain contracts are considered leases and are therefore not included here, but are included in Note 10. NOTE 16(c) Legal Proceedings - Flood Damage Claims - In 2013, several plaintiffs purporting to represent a class of residential and commercial property owners filed a complaint against CRANDIC, Alliant Energy and various other defendants in the Iowa District Court for Linn County. Plaintiffs assert claims of negligence and strict liability based on their allegations that CRANDIC (along with other defendants) caused or exacerbated flooding of the Cedar River in June 2008. In February 2016, the Iowa District Court for Linn County ruled in favor of Alliant Energy and CRANDIC and dismissed all claims against them, resulting in no loss. In August 2016, the Iowa District Court for Linn County dismissed all claims against the remaining defendants. In September 2016, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Iowa. Alliant Energy does not currently believe any material losses for this complaint are both probable and reasonably estimated, and therefore has not recognized any material loss contingency amounts as of December 31, 2016. Other - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are involved in other legal and administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although unable to predict the outcome of these matters, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe that appropriate reserves have been established and final disposition of these actions will not have a material effect on their financial condition or results of operations. NOTE 16(d) Guarantees and Indemnifications - RMT - In 2013, Alliant Energy sold RMT. RMT provided renewable energy services, including construction and high voltage connection services for wind and solar projects. As part of the sale, Alliant Energy indemnified the buyer for any claims, including claims of warranty under the project obligations that were commenced or are based on actions that occurred prior to the sale, except for liabilities already accounted for through adjustments to the purchase price. In 2016, the indemnification obligations and contractual warranty periods expired; however, limited warranties may be extended in certain cases for warranty work performed. Alliant Energy also continues to guarantee RMT’s performance obligations related to certain of RMT’s projects that were commenced prior to Alliant Energy’s sale of RMT. As of December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy had $75 million of performance guarantees outstanding, which are currently expected to expire in 2017. The expiration of these performance guarantees may be extended depending on when all valid warranty claims are resolved for the respective projects. Although Alliant Energy has received warranty claims related to certain of these projects, it does not currently believe that material losses are both probable and reasonably estimated, and therefore, has not recognized any material liabilities related to these matters as of December 31, 2016. Alliant Energy does not currently believe that the range of future potential loss from any warranty claims will be material. Refer to Note 19 for further discussion of RMT, including amounts Alliant Energy recorded to “Operating expenses” in 2016, 2015 and 2014 related to certain warranty claims. Whiting Petroleum - In 2004, Alliant Energy sold its remaining interest in Whiting Petroleum. Whiting Petroleum is an independent oil and gas company. Alliant Energy Resources, LLC, as the successor to a predecessor entity that owned Whiting Petroleum, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF, continues to guarantee the partnership obligations of an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum under general partnership agreements in the oil and gas industry, including with respect to the future abandonment of certain platforms off the coast of California and related onshore plant and equipment owned by the partnerships. The guarantees do not include a maximum limit. As of December 31, 2016, the present value of the abandonment obligations is estimated at $31 million. Alliant Energy is not aware of any material liabilities related to these guarantees of which it is probable that Alliant Energy Resources, LLC will be obligated to pay and therefore has not recognized any material liabilities related to this guarantee as of December 31, 2016. IPL’s Minnesota Electric Distribution Assets - IPL provided indemnifications associated with the July 2015 sale of its Minnesota electric distribution assets for losses resulting from potential breach of IPL’s representations, warranties and obligations under the sale agreement. Alliant Energy and IPL believe the likelihood of having to make any material cash payments under these indemnifications is remote. IPL has not recorded any material liabilities related to these indemnifications as of December 31, 2016. The general terms of the indemnifications provided by IPL included a maximum limit of $17 million and expire in October 2020. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of the sale of IPL’s Minnesota electric distribution assets. NOTE 16(e) Environmental Matters - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to environmental regulations as a result of their current and past operations. These regulations are designed to protect public health and the environment and have resulted in compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations, which are recorded as current and non-current environmental liabilities. Substantially all of the environmental liabilities recorded on the balance sheets relate to MGP sites. MGP Sites - IPL and WPL have current or previous ownership interests in various sites that are previously associated with the production of gas for which IPL and WPL have, or may have in the future, liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs. IPL and WPL are working pursuant to the requirements of various federal and state agencies to investigate, mitigate, prevent and remediate, where necessary, the environmental impacts to property, including natural resources, at and around these former MGP sites in order to protect public health and the environment. Environmental liabilities related to these MGP sites are recorded based upon periodic studies. Such amounts are based on the best current estimate of the remaining amount to be incurred for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs for those sites where the investigation process has been or is substantially completed, and the minimum of the estimated cost range for those sites where the investigation is in its earlier stages. There are inherent uncertainties associated with the estimated remaining costs for MGP projects primarily due to unknown site conditions and potential changes in regulatory agency requirements. It is possible that future cost estimates will be greater than current estimates as the investigation process proceeds and as additional facts become known. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted. At December 31, 2016, estimated future costs expected to be incurred for the investigation, remediation and monitoring of the MGP sites, as well as environmental liabilities recorded on the balance sheets for these sites, were as follows (in millions). At December 31, 2016, such amounts for WPL were not material. Refer to Note 2 for discussion of regulatory assets recorded by IPL and WPL, which reflect the probable future rate recovery of MGP expenditures. Considering the current rate treatment, and assuming no material change therein, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe that the clean-up costs incurred for these MGP sites will not have a material effect on their financial condition or results of operations. WPL Consent Decree - In 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin approved a Consent Decree that WPL, along with the other owners of Edgewater and Columbia, entered into with the EPA and the Sierra Club, thereby resolving claims against WPL. Such claims included allegations that the owners of Edgewater, Nelson Dewey and Columbia violated the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program requirements, Title V Operating Permit requirements of the CAA and the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan designed to implement the CAA. WPL has completed various requirements under the Consent Decree. WPL’s remaining requirements include installing an SCR system at Columbia Unit 2 and fuel switching or retiring Edgewater Unit 4 by December 31, 2018. The Consent Decree also establishes SO2, NOx and particulate matter emission rate limits for Columbia Units 1 and 2, and Edgewater Units 4 and 5. In addition, the Consent Decree includes annual plant-wide SO2 and NOx emission caps for Columbia and Edgewater. WPL is in the process of completing approximately $7 million in environmental mitigation projects. Alliant Energy and WPL currently expect to recover material costs incurred by WPL related to compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree from WPL’s electric customers. IPL Consent Decree - In 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa approved a Consent Decree that IPL entered into with the EPA, the Sierra Club, the State of Iowa and Linn County in Iowa, thereby resolving potential CAA issues associated with emissions from IPL’s coal-fired generating facilities in Iowa. IPL has completed various requirements under the Consent Decree. IPL’s remaining requirements include installing an SCR system or equivalent NOx reduction system at the Ottumwa Generating Station by December 31, 2019; fuel switching or retiring Prairie Creek Unit 4 by June 1, 2018, the Burlington Generating Station by December 31, 2021 and Prairie Creek Units 1 and 3 by December 31, 2025; and either installing combined cycle technology at, or retiring, the Dubuque and Sutherland Generating Stations by June 1, 2019. The Consent Decree also establishes SO2, NOx and particulate matter emission rate limits with varying averaging times for the Burlington, Lansing, M.L. Kapp, Ottumwa and Prairie Creek Generating Stations. In addition, the Consent Decree includes calendar-year SO2 and NOx emission caps for the Prairie Creek Generating Station, and calendar-year SO2 and NOx emission caps in aggregate for the Burlington, Dubuque, Lansing, M.L. Kapp, Ottumwa, Prairie Creek and Sutherland Generating Stations. IPL is in the process of completing approximately $6 million in environmental mitigation projects. Alliant Energy and IPL currently expect to recover material costs incurred by IPL related to the environmental control systems and environmental mitigation projects from IPL’s electric customers. Other Environmental Contingencies - In addition to the environmental liabilities discussed above, various environmental rules are monitored that may have a significant impact on future operations. Several of these environmental rules are subject to legal challenges, reconsideration and/or other uncertainties. Given uncertainties regarding the outcome, timing and compliance plans for these environmental matters, the complete financial impact of each of these rules is not able to be determined; however future capital investments and/or modifications to EGUs to comply with certain of these rules could be significant. Specific current, proposed or potential environmental matters include, among others: CSAPR, Effluent Limitation Guidelines, CCR Rule, and various legislation and EPA regulations to monitor and regulate the emission of GHG, including carbon emissions from new (CAA Section 111(b)) and existing (CAA Section 111(d)) fossil-fueled EGUs. NOTE 16(f) Credit Risk - IPL and WPL provide regulated electricity and natural gas services to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale customers in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois for IPL and Wisconsin for WPL. The geographic concentration of these customers did not contribute significantly to overall credit risk exposure. In addition, as a result of a diverse customer base, IPL and WPL did not have any significant credit risk concentration for receivables arising from the sale of electricity or natural gas services. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to credit risk related to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities and other goods or services at the contracted price. Credit policies are maintained to mitigate credit risk. These credit policies include evaluation of the financial condition of certain counterparties, use of credit risk-related contingent provisions in certain agreements that require credit support from counterparties not meeting specific criteria, diversification of counterparties to reduce concentrations of credit risk and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with certain counterparties. Based on these credit policies and counterparty diversification, as well as utility cost recovery mechanisms, it is unlikely that counterparty non-performance would have a material effect on financial condition or results of operations. However, there is no assurance that these items will protect against all losses from counterparty non-performance. Refer to Notes 5(a) and 15 for details of allowances for doubtful accounts and credit risk-related contingent features, respectively. NOTE 16(g) Collective Bargaining Agreements - At December 31, 2016, employees covered by collective bargaining agreements represented 56%, 65% and 81% of total employees of Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL, respectively. In August 2017, IPL’s collective bargaining agreement with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 204 (Cedar Rapids) expires, representing 19% and 46% of total employees of Alliant Energy and IPL, respectively. NOTE 17. SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS Alliant Energy - Alliant Energy’s principal businesses as of December 31, 2016 are: • Utility - includes the operations of IPL and WPL, which primarily serve retail customers in Iowa and Wisconsin. The utility business has three reportable segments: a) utility electric operations, which include Alliant Energy’s investment in ATC; b) utility gas operations; and c) utility other, which includes steam operations and the unallocated portions of the utility business. Various line items in the following tables are not allocated to the electric and gas segments for management reporting purposes, and therefore, are included only in “Total Utility.” • Non-regulated, Parent and Other - includes the operations of AEF and its subsidiaries, Corporate Services, the Alliant Energy parent company, and any Alliant Energy parent company consolidating adjustments. AEF’s businesses include Transportation, Non-regulated Generation and other non-regulated investments described in Note 1(a). Alliant Energy’s administrative support services are directly charged to the applicable segment where practicable. In all other cases, administrative support services are allocated to the applicable segment based on services agreements. Intersegment revenues were not material to Alliant Energy’s operations and there was no single customer whose revenues were 10% or more of Alliant Energy’s consolidated revenues. All of Alliant Energy’s operations and assets are located in the U.S. Certain financial information relating to Alliant Energy’s business segments, which represent the services provided to its customers, was as follows (in millions): IPL - IPL is a utility primarily serving retail customers in Iowa and includes three reportable segments: a) electric operations; b) gas operations; and c) other, which includes steam operations and the unallocated portions of the utility business.

RELATED PARTIES Service Agreements - IPL and WPL are parties to service agreements with an affiliate, Corporate Services. Pursuant to these service agreements, IPL and WPL receive various administrative and general services. These services are billed to IPL and WPL at cost based on expenses incurred by Corporate Services for the benefit of IPL and WPL, respectively. These costs consisted primarily of employee compensation and benefits, fees associated with various professional services, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, and a return on net assets. Corporate Services also acts as agent on behalf of IPL and WPL pursuant to the service agreements. As agent, Corporate Services enters into energy, capacity, ancillary services, and transmission sale and purchase transactions within MISO. Corporate Services assigns such sales and purchases among IPL and WPL based on statements received from MISO. The amounts billed for services provided, sales credited and purchases were as follows (in millions): As of December 31, net intercompany payables to Corporate Services were as follows (in millions): ATC - Pursuant to various agreements, WPL receives a range of transmission services from ATC. WPL provides operation, maintenance, and construction services to ATC. WPL and ATC also bill each other for use of shared facilities owned by each party.

            " INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Digerati Technologies, Inc. San Antonio, Texas We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Digerati Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Digerati”) as of July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of Digerati’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. Digerati is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Digerati’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Digerati as of July 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that Digerati will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Digerati suffered losses from operations and has a working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ LBB & Associates Ltd., LLP LBB & Associates Ltd., LLP Houston, Texas October 24, 2016 PART 1.

AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (In thousands) See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements DIGERATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business. Digerati Technologies, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “Digerati”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 24, 2004. Digerati is a diversified holding company that has no independent operations apart from its subsidiaries. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Shift8 Technologies, Inc., we are an established cloud telephony service provider that offers a comprehensive suite of cloud communication services to meet the global needs of businesses that are seeking simple, flexible, and cost effective communication solutions. Unlike legacy phone systems, our telephony services are delivered Only in the Cloud ™, or over the Internet, making service available to customers from anywhere internet access is available. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Digerati, and its subsidiaries, which are majority owned by Digerati In accordance with ASC 810-10-05. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Reclassifications. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current year for comparative purposes. Use of Estimates. In preparing financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenue and expenses in the statement of operations. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject Digerati to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. In the normal course of business, Digerati provides credit terms to its customers. Accordingly, Digerati performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses, which, when realized, have been within the range of management’s expectations. Digerati maintains cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Digerati has not experienced any losses in such accounts and Digerati does not believe it’s exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. Revenue Recognition. Digerati derives revenue from two product offerings Global VoIP Services and Cloud Communication Services. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been provided, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining. Digerati records and reports its revenue on the gross amount billed to its customers in accordance with the following indicators: ●Digerati is the primary obligor in its arrangements, ●Digerati has latitude in establishing pricing, ●Digerati changes the product or performs part of the service and is involved in the determination of the product or service specifications, ●Digerati has discretion in supplier selection and ●Digerati assumes credit risk for the amount billed to the customer. Sources of revenue: Global VoIP Services: We currently provide VoIP communication services to U.S. and foreign telecommunications companies that lack transmission facilities, require additional capacity or do not have the regulatory licenses to terminate traffic in Mexico, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Typically, these telecommunications companies offer their services to the public for domestic and international long distance services Cloud Communication Services: We provide cloud communication services to value-added resellers and enterprise customers. The service includes fully hosted IP/PBX services, IP trunking, call center applications, prepaid services, interactive voice response auto attendant, call recording, simultaneous calling, voicemail to email conversion, and multiple customized IP/PBX features in a hosted or cloud environment for specialized applications. Cost of Services: Global VoIP Services: We incur transmission and termination charges from our suppliers and the providers of the infrastructure and network. The cost is based on rate per minute, volume of minutes transported and terminated through the network. Additionally, we incur fixed Internet bandwidth charges and per minute billing charges. In some cases we incur installation charges from certain carriers. These installation costs are passed on to our customers for the connection to our VoIP network. Cloud Communication Services: We incur bandwidth, licensing, and co-location charges in connection with cloud communication services. The bandwidth charges are incurred as part of the connection between our customers to allow them access to our services. Cash and cash equivalents. The Company considers all bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Bad debt expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of likely losses each year based on past experience and an estimate of current year uncollectible amounts. As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, Digerati’s allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $0 and $0, respectively. Property and equipment. Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Additions are capitalized and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Gains and losses on dispositions of equipment are reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are one to five years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Digerati reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. Digerati assesses recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair value. Derivative financial instruments. Digerati does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. However, Digerati analyzes its convertible instruments and free-standing instruments such as warrants for derivative liability accounting. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. For option-based derivative financial instruments, Digerati uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is probable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. Income taxes. Digerati recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. Digerati provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not. Since January 1, 2007, Digerati accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on income taxes which addresses how an entity should recognize, measure and present in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Pursuant to this guidance, Digerati recognizes a tax benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the “more likely than not” standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Currently, we have $2,622,867 in accrued liabilities as of July 31, 2016 and no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded as of July 31, 2015. Stock-based compensation. Digerati accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the provisions on share-based payments which require measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Basic and diluted net loss per share. The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an “as if converted” basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the year ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, potential dilutive securities had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share. Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is used which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy based on the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. For certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates its fair value based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. Our derivative liabilities as of July 31, 2016 and 2015 were $0 and were valued using Level 3 inputs. Recently issued accounting pronouncements. Digerati does not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on Digerati’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN Financial Condition Digerati’s consolidated financial statements for the year ending July 31, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Digerati has incurred net losses and accumulated a deficit of approximately $78,076,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $2,516,000 which raises substantial doubt about Digerati’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management Plans to Continue as a Going Concern Management believes that current available resources will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations over the next 12 months. The Company’s ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company will seek to secure such additional funding from various possible sources, including the public equity market, private financings, sales of assets, collaborative arrangements and debt. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds, or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to delay or reduce the scope of its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due. The Company will continue to work with various funding sources to secure additional debt and equity financings. However, Digerati cannot offer any assurance that it will be successful in executing the aforementioned plans to continue as a going concern. Digerati’s consolidated financial statements as of July 31, 2016 do not include any adjustments that might result from the inability to implement or execute Digerati’s plans to improve our ability to continue as a going concern.

The note receivable had a maturity date of June 26, 2008 with interest at 8% per year. The note was secured by NetSapiens’ proprietary Starter Platform License and SNAPsolution modules.

The License provides Digerati with the ability to offer Hosted PBX (Private Branch eXchange), IP Centrex application, prepaid calling, call center, conferencing, messaging and other innovative telephony functionality necessary to offer standard and/or custom services to the Residential and Enterprise markets. The NetSapiens’ License is being amortized equally over a period of 10 years.

NOTE 6 - DEBT At July 31, 2016 and 2015, outstanding debt consisted of the following: (In thousands). In November 2013, Shift8 Networks, Inc., an operating subsidiary of Digerati, entered into a note payable with Mr. Arthur L. Smith, in the amount of $46,755. The note had an implied annual interest rate of 0% and a maturity date of February 28, 2014. Subsequently, Mr. Smith agreed to extend the maturity date of the promissory note to November 30, 2014 and later agreed to extend the maturity date to April 30, 2015. On January 31, 2015, Shift8 Networks and Mr. Smith agreed to renew and extend the maturity date on the promissory note to October 31, 2015. The renewed note had an implied annual interest rate of 3%. On October 9, 2015 Shift8 Networks paid off the total outstanding principal balance and accrued interest. On August 21, 2015 the Company entered into a short term promissory note payable for $25,000 with Craig K. Clement, the Company’s Chairman of the Board. The note had an implied annual interest rate of 0% and a maturity date of October 31, 2015. On October 15, 2015 the Company paid off the total outstanding principal balance. NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES Digerati files a consolidated tax return. The current tax year is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and certain state taxing authorities. As of July 31, 2016, Digerati had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $1,023,000 to reduce future federal income tax liabilities. Income tax benefit (provision) for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: The effective tax rate for Digerati is reconciled to statutory rates as follows: Deferred tax assets are comprised of the following as of July 31, 2016 and 2015: At July 31, 2016, realization of Digerati’s deferred tax assets was not considered likely to be realized. The change in the valuation allowance for 2016 was approximately $6,075,000. Management has evaluated and concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in Digerati’s combined financial statements. The current year remains open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which Digerati is subject to tax. As a result of the reverse split in 2013 outstanding common shares was 1,977,626 as of July 31, 2014 and the sale of 2,279,412 common shares in January 2015 resulted in a change of control and the net operation loss became subject to the separate return limitation year, thus the net operating loss was reduced. The Company files a calendar year return and the net operating loss was adjusted for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. We record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluate on new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. Currently, we have $2,622,867 in accrued liabilities as of July 31, 2016. NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments Digerati leases its office space with monthly payments of $580; the lease is on a month to month basis. The annual rent expense under the operating lease was $7,740 and $8,715 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The future minimum lease payment under the operating lease for fiscal year 2017 is $6,960. Contingencies On May 1, 2014, Recap Marketing & Consulting LLP, Rainmaker Ventures II, Ltd and WEM Equity Capital investments, Ltd. filed an arbitration claim pursuant to the Bankruptcy Settlement Agreement. On July 19, 2014, the arbitrator entered a decision that Recap Marketing & Consulting LLP was entitled to the transfer of 20,600 shares of Digerati Common Stock that were outstanding as of the date of the November Transactions and reflected on Digerati's stockholder list as being held by other stockholders who were principals of Recap Marketing & Consulting, LLP. Recap Marketing & Consulting LLP and Rainmaker Ventures II, Ltd. subsequently challenged the findings of the arbitrator by filing a motion to vacate in In Re Digerati Technologies, Inc. On November 23, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order dismissing the motion vacate. From time to time Digerati is involved in various litigations in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s management believes existing litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of Digerati. NOTE 9 - STOCK -BASED COMPENSATION In November 2015, Digerati adopted the Digerati Technologies, Inc. 2015 Equity Compensation Plan (the “Plan”).

Digerati’s Board of Directors determines the terms of any grants under the Plan. Exercise prices of all stock options and other awards vary based on the market price of the shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The stock options, restricted common stock, non-restricted common stock and other awards vest based on the terms of the individual grant.

ALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION INTERSTATE POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY WISCONSIN POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES NOTE 1(a) General - Description of Business - Alliant Energy’s financial statements include the accounts of Alliant Energy and its consolidated subsidiaries. Alliant Energy is an investor-owned public utility holding company, whose primary wholly-owned subsidiaries are IPL, WPL, AEF and Corporate Services. IPL’s financial statements include the accounts of IPL and its consolidated subsidiary, IPL SPE LLC, which is used for IPL’s sales of accounts receivable program. IPL is a direct subsidiary of Alliant Energy and is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas to retail customers in select markets in Iowa. IPL also sells electricity to wholesale customers in Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa, and is engaged in the generation and distribution of steam for two customers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. WPL’s financial statements include the accounts of WPL and its consolidated subsidiary, WPL Transco, which held Alliant Energy’s investment in ATC until December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 6(a) for discussion of WPL’s transfer of its investment in ATC to ATI on December 31, 2016. WPL is a direct subsidiary of Alliant Energy and is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas to retail customers in select markets in Wisconsin. WPL also sells electricity to wholesale customers in Wisconsin. AEF is comprised of Transportation, Non-regulated Generation, ATI and other non-regulated investments. Transportation includes a short-line railway that provides freight service between Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; barge terminal and hauling services on the Mississippi River; and other transfer and storage services. Non-regulated Generation owns Sheboygan Falls, a 347 MW, simple-cycle, natural gas-fired EGU near Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, which is leased to WPL for an initial period of 20 years ending in 2025. In addition, Non-regulated Generation currently owns the non-regulated 99 MW Franklin County wind farm located in Franklin County, Iowa. In February 2017, FERC issued an order approving the transfer of the Franklin County wind farm from AEF to IPL. Alliant Energy and IPL currently expect to complete this transfer in 2017. ATI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF, held a partial interest in WPL Transco until December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, ATI holds all of Alliant Energy’s investment in ATC. Refer to Note 6(a) for further discussion of the transfer of WPL’s ATC investment to ATI. Corporate Services is the subsidiary formed to provide administrative services to Alliant Energy and its subsidiaries. Basis of Presentation - The financial statements reflect investments in controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s proportionate shares of jointly-owned utility EGUs. Unconsolidated investments, which Alliant Energy and WPL do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, Alliant Energy and WPL initially record the investment at cost, and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize their respective share of the earnings or losses of the investee. Dividends received from an investee reduce the carrying amount of the equity investment. Investments that do not meet the criteria for consolidation or the equity method of accounting are accounted for under the cost method. Refer to Notes 1(m) and 6(a) for further discussion of VIEs and equity method investments, respectively. All intercompany balances and transactions, other than certain transactions affecting the rate-making process at IPL and WPL, have been eliminated from the financial statements. Such transactions not eliminated include costs that are recoverable from customers through rate-making processes. The financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which give recognition to the rate-making and accounting practices of FERC and state commissions having regulatory jurisdiction. Certain prior period amounts in the Financial Statements and Notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation for comparative purposes. Unless otherwise noted, the notes herein exclude discontinued operations for all periods presented. As discussed in Note 7, all Alliant Energy share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a two-for-one common stock split distributed in May 2016. As required by GAAP, all prior period financial statements and disclosures presented herein have been restated to reflect the common stock split. Use of Estimates - The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect: (a) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and (b) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. NOTE 1(b) Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by FERC and various state regulatory commissions. As a result, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to GAAP provisions for regulated operations, which provide that rate-regulated public utilities record certain costs and credits allowed in the rate-making process in different periods than for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred as such costs are probable of recovery in future customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers or amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred. Amounts deferred as regulatory assets or accrued as regulatory liabilities are generally recognized in the income statements at the time they are reflected in rates. Refer to Note 2 for additional discussion of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities. NOTE 1(c) Income Taxes - The liability method of accounting is followed for deferred taxes, which requires the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as appropriate, for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the financial statements. Deferred taxes are recorded using currently enacted tax rates and estimates of state apportionment. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with certain property-related differences at IPL are accounted for differently than other subsidiaries of Alliant Energy due to rate-making practices in Iowa. Rate-making practices in Iowa do not include the impact of certain deferred tax expenses (benefits) in the determination of retail rates. Based on these rate-making practices, deferred tax expense (benefit) related to these property-related differences at IPL is not recorded in the income statement but instead recorded to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities until these temporary differences reverse. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of these tax regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities associated with property-related differences at IPL. In Wisconsin, the PSCW has allowed rate recovery of deferred tax expense on all temporary differences since 1991. Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over the average lives of the related property. Other tax credits reduce income tax expense in the year claimed. Alliant Energy files a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined return in Wisconsin, which include Alliant Energy and its subsidiaries. Alliant Energy subsidiaries with a presence in Iowa file as part of a consolidated return in Iowa. Alliant Energy allocates consolidated income tax expense to its subsidiaries that are members of the group that file a consolidated or combined income tax return. IPL and WPL use the modified separate return approach for calculating their income tax provisions and related deferred tax assets and liabilities. IPL and WPL are assumed to file separate tax returns with the federal and state taxing authorities, except that net operating losses (and other current or deferred tax attributes) are characterized as realized (or realizable) by IPL and WPL when those tax attributes are realized (or realizable) by the consolidated tax return group of Alliant Energy (even if IPL and WPL would not otherwise have realized the attributes on a stand-alone basis). The difference in the income taxes recorded for IPL and WPL under the modified separate return method compared to the income taxes recorded on a separate return basis was not material in 2016, 2015 and 2014. NOTE 1(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include short-term liquid investments that have original maturities of less than 90 days. NOTE 1(e) Property, Plant and Equipment - Utility Plant - General - Utility plant is recorded at the original cost of acquisition or construction, which includes material, labor, contractor services, AFUDC and allocable overheads, such as supervision, engineering, benefits, certain taxes and transportation. Repairs, replacements and renewals of items of property determined to be less than a unit of property or that do not increase the property’s life or functionality are charged to maintenance expense. Generally, ordinary retirements of utility plant and salvage value are netted and charged to accumulated depreciation upon removal from utility plant accounts and no gain or loss is recognized consistent with rate-making policies. However, if regulators have approved recovery of the remaining net book value of property, plant and equipment that is retired early, the remaining net book value is reclassified from property, plant and equipment to regulatory assets upon retirement. Property, plant and equipment that is probable of being retired early is classified as plant anticipated to be retired early. Depreciation - IPL and WPL use a combination of remaining life and straight-line depreciation methods as approved by their respective regulatory commissions. The composite or group method of depreciation is used, in which a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property. This method pools similar assets and then depreciates each group as a whole. Periodic depreciation studies are performed to determine the appropriate group lives, net salvage, estimated cost of removal and group depreciation rates. These depreciation studies are subject to review and approval by IPL’s and WPL’s respective regulatory commissions. Depreciation expense is included within the recoverable cost of service component of rates charged to customers. The average rates of depreciation for electric, gas and other properties, consistent with current rate-making practices, were as follows: In September 2016, the PSCW issued an order approving the implementation of updated depreciation rates for WPL effective January 1, 2017 as a result of a recently completed depreciation study. WPL estimates the new average rates of depreciation for its electric generation, electric distribution and gas properties will be approximately 3.2%, 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively, during 2017. AFUDC - AFUDC represents costs to finance construction additions, including a return on equity component and cost of debt component as required by regulatory accounting. AFUDC for IPL’s construction projects is calculated in accordance with FERC guidelines. AFUDC for WPL’s retail and wholesale jurisdiction construction projects is calculated in accordance with PSCW and FERC guidelines, respectively. The AFUDC rates, computed in accordance with the prescribed regulatory formula, were as follows: (a) In 2013, the IUB issued an order establishing rate-making principles for Marshalltown that requires a 10.3% return on common equity for the calculation of AFUDC related to the construction of such facility. In accordance with their most recent rate orders, IPL applies its AFUDC rates to 100% of applicable CWIP balances and WPL generally applies its AFUDC rates to 50% of applicable CWIP balances. WPL may apply its AFUDC rates to 100% of the retail portion of the CWIP balances for construction projects requiring a CA or CPCN that were approved by the PSCW after its most recent rate order, including the Riverside expansion. Non-utility Property - General - Non-utility property is recorded at the original cost of acquisition or construction, which includes material, labor and contractor services. Repairs, replacements and renewals of items of property determined to be less than a unit of property or that do not increase the property’s life or functionality are charged to maintenance expense. Upon retirement or sale of non-utility property, the original cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the income statements. Costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related software. If software is retired prior to being fully amortized, the difference is recorded as a loss in the income statements. NOTE 1(f) Operating Revenues - Utility - Revenues from Alliant Energy’s utility business are primarily from electricity and natural gas sales and are recognized on an accrual basis as services are rendered or commodities are delivered to customers. Energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of customers’ meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout each reporting period. Amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated at the end of each reporting period and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is recorded in such reporting period. The unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes, estimated customer usage by class, temperature impacts, line losses and the most recent customer rates. IPL and WPL accrue revenues from their wholesale customers to the extent that the actual net revenue requirements calculated in accordance with FERC-approved formula rates for the reporting period are higher or lower than the amounts billed to wholesale customers during such period. Regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities are recorded as the offset for these accrued revenues under formulaic rate-making programs. IPL’s estimated recovery amount is recorded in the current period of service and is reflected in customer bills within two years under the provisions of approved formula rates. WPL’s estimated recovery amount is recorded in the current period of service and subject to final adjustments after a customer audit period in the subsequent year. Final settled recovery amounts are reflected in WPL’s customer bills within two years under the provisions of approved formula rates. IPL and WPL participate in bid/offer-based wholesale energy and ancillary services markets operated by MISO. MISO requires that all load serving entities and generation owners, including IPL and WPL, submit hourly day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for energy and ancillary services. The MISO day-ahead and real-time transactions are grouped together, resulting in a net supply to or net purchase from MISO for each hour of each day. The net supply to MISO is recorded in “Electric utility operating revenues” and the net purchase from MISO is recorded in “Electric production fuel and purchased power” in the income statements. Non-regulated - Revenues from Alliant Energy’s non-regulated businesses are primarily from its Transportation business and are recognized on an accrual basis as services are rendered or goods are delivered to customers. Taxes Collected from Customers - Sales or various other taxes collected by certain of Alliant Energy’s subsidiaries on behalf of other agencies are recorded on a net basis and are not included in operating revenues. Revenue Recognition - Refer to Note 1(o) for discussion of a new accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in 2014, which provides principles for recognizing revenue. NOTE 1(g) Utility Cost Recovery Mechanisms - Electric Production Fuel and Purchased Power (Fuel-related Costs) - Fuel-related costs are incurred to generate and purchase electricity to meet the demand of IPL’s and WPL’s electric customers. These fuel-related costs include the cost of fossil fuels (primarily natural gas and coal) used to produce electricity at their EGUs, electricity purchased from MISO wholesale energy markets and under PPAs, costs for allowances acquired to allow certain emissions (primarily SO2 and NOx) from their EGUs and costs for chemicals utilized to control emissions from their EGUs. These fuel-related costs are recorded in “Electric production fuel and purchased power” in the income statements. IPL Retail - The cost recovery mechanisms for IPL’s retail electric customers provide for monthly adjustments to their electric rates for changes in fuel-related costs. Fuel adjustment clause rules applicable to IPL’s retail jurisdiction also allow recovery of prudently incurred costs for emission allowances required to comply with EPA regulations through the fuel adjustment clause. Changes in the under-/over-collection of these costs are recognized in “Electric production fuel and purchased power” in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s income statements. The cumulative effects of the under-/over-collection of these costs are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. WPL Retail - The cost recovery mechanism for WPL’s retail electric customers is based on forecasts of certain fuel-related costs expected to be incurred during forward-looking test year periods and fuel monitoring ranges determined by the PSCW during each retail electric rate proceeding or in a separate fuel cost plan approval proceeding. If WPL’s actual fuel-related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges, WPL is authorized to defer the incremental under-/over-collection of fuel-related costs that are outside the approved ranges. Deferral of under-collections are reduced to the extent actual return on common equity earned by WPL during the fuel cost plan year exceeds the most recently authorized return on common equity. Deferred amounts for fuel-related costs outside the approved fuel monitoring ranges are recognized in “Electric production fuel and purchased power” in Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s income statements. The cumulative effects of these deferred amounts are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. IPL and WPL Wholesale - The cost recovery mechanisms for IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale electric customers provide for subsequent adjustments to their electric rates for changes in fuel-related costs. Changes in the under-/over-collection of these costs are recognized in “Electric production fuel and purchased power” in the income statements. The cumulative effects of the under-/over-collection of these costs are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. IPL’s and WPL’s costs for emission allowances are excluded from the fuel- related cost recovery mechanisms and are recovered from their wholesale electric customers through annual changes in base rates determined by a formula rate structure. Purchased Electric Capacity - PPAs help meet the electricity demand of IPL’s and WPL’s customers. Certain of these PPAs include minimum payments for IPL’s and WPL’s rights to electric generating capacity, which are charged each period to “Electric production fuel and purchased power” in the income statements. Purchased electric capacity expenses are recovered from IPL’s and WPL’s retail electric customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings. Purchased electric capacity expenses are recovered from IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale electric customers through annual changes in base rates determined by a formula rate structure. Electric Transmission Service - Costs incurred for the transmission of electricity to meet the demands of IPL’s and WPL’s customers are charged to “Electric transmission service” in the income statements. IPL Retail - Electric transmission service expense is recovered from IPL’s retail electric customers through a transmission cost rider. This cost recovery mechanism provides for annual adjustments to electric rates charged to retail electric customers for changes in electric transmission service expense. Changes in the under-/over-collection of these costs are recognized in “Electric transmission service” in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s income statements. The cumulative effects of the under-/over-collection of these costs are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. The transmission cost rider will remain in effect until the IUB’s final decision in IPL’s next retail electric base rate case, at which time the rider will continue in its current form, continue in a modified form or be terminated. WPL Retail - Electric transmission service expense is recovered from WPL’s retail electric customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings. Pursuant to the escrow accounting treatment WPL received as part of its approved retail electric rate case (2015/2016 Test Period) in 2014 from the PSCW, the difference between actual electric transmission service expense incurred and the amount of electric transmission service costs collected from customers as electric revenues in 2015 and 2016 is recognized in “Electric transmission service” in Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s income statements. An offsetting amount is recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s balance sheets until reflected in future billings to customers. The PSCW’s December 2016 order for WPL’s retail electric rate case (2017/2018 Test Period) extends this escrow accounting treatment through 2018. IPL and WPL Wholesale - IPL and WPL arrange transmission service for the majority of their respective wholesale electric customers. Electric transmission service expense is allocated to and recovered from these customers based on a load ratio share computation. Cost of Gas Sold - Costs are incurred for the purchase, transportation and storage of natural gas to serve IPL’s and WPL’s gas customers and the costs associated with the natural gas delivered to customers are charged to “Cost of gas sold” in the income statements. The tariffs for IPL’s and WPL’s retail gas customers provide for subsequent adjustments to their rates each month for changes in the cost of gas sold. Changes in the under-/over-collection of these costs are also recognized in “Cost of gas sold” in the income statements. The cumulative effects of the under-/over-collection of these costs are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. Energy Efficiency Costs - Costs are incurred to fund energy efficiency programs and initiatives that help customers reduce their energy usage. The costs incurred for these programs and initiatives are charged to “Other operation and maintenance” in the income statements. Energy efficiency costs incurred by IPL are recovered from its retail electric and gas customers through an additional tariff called an energy efficiency cost recovery factor, which is revised annually and includes a reconciliation to eliminate any under-/over-collection of energy efficiency costs from prior periods. Energy efficiency costs incurred by WPL are recovered from retail electric and gas customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings. Reconciliations of any under-/over-collection of energy efficiency costs from prior periods are also addressed in WPL’s periodic rate proceedings. Changes in the under-/over-collection of energy efficiency costs for IPL and WPL are recognized in “Other operation and maintenance” in the income statements. The cumulative effects of the under-/over-collection of these costs for IPL and WPL are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. Refer to Note 2 for additional information regarding these utility cost recovery mechanisms. NOTE 1(h) Financial Instruments - Financial instruments are periodically used for risk management purposes to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in certain commodity prices and transmission congestion costs. The fair value of those financial instruments that are determined to be derivatives are recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheets. Certain commodity purchase and sales contracts qualify for and have been designated under the normal purchase and sale exception and are accounted for on the accrual basis of accounting. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL have elected to not net the fair value amounts of derivatives subject to a master netting arrangement by counterparty. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL do not offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (payable) against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments that are executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. Refer to Note 2 for discussion of the recognition of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities related to the unrealized losses and gains on IPL’s and WPL’s derivative instruments. Refer to Notes 14, 15 and 16(f) for further discussion of derivatives and related credit risk. NOTE 1(i) Asset Impairments - Property, Plant and Equipment of Regulated Operations - Property, plant and equipment of regulated operations are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate all or a portion of the carrying value of the assets may be disallowed for rate-making purposes. If IPL or WPL are disallowed recovery of any portion of the carrying value of their regulated property, plant and equipment that is under construction, has been recently completed or is probable of abandonment, or conclude it is probable recovery will be disallowed, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value that was disallowed or is probable of being disallowed. If IPL or WPL are only allowed a partial return on the carrying value of their regulated property, plant and equipment that is under construction, has been recently completed or is probable of abandonment, or conclude it is probable a full return will not be allowed, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value and the present value of the future revenues expected from their regulated property, plant and equipment. Property, Plant and Equipment of Non-regulated Operations - Property, plant and equipment of non-regulated operations are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted future cash flows. If an impairment is indicated, a charge is recognized equal to the amount the carrying value exceeds the asset’s fair value. Refer to Note 3 for discussion of Alliant Energy’s impairment analysis of the Franklin County wind farm assets in 2016 and resulting asset valuation charges recorded by Alliant Energy in 2016. Unconsolidated Equity Investments - If events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting exceeds fair value and the decline in value is other than temporary, potential impairment is assessed. If an impairment is indicated, a charge is recognized equal to the amount the carrying value exceeds the investment’s fair value. Refer to Note 6(a) for additional discussion of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting. NOTE 1(j) Asset Retirement Obligations - The fair value of a legal obligation associated with the retirement of an asset is recorded as a liability when an asset is placed in service, when a legal obligation is subsequently identified or when sufficient information becomes available to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of future retirement costs. When an ARO is recorded as a liability, an equivalent amount is added to the asset cost. The fair value of AROs at inception is determined using discounted cash flows analyses. The liability is accreted to its present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Accretion and depreciation expenses related to AROs for IPL’s and WPL’s regulated operations are recorded to regulatory assets on the balance sheets. Upon regulatory approval to recover IPL’s AROs expenditures, its regulatory assets are amortized to depreciation and amortization expenses in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s income statements over the same time period the ARO expenditures are recovered from IPL’s customers. WPL’s regulatory assets related to AROs are being recovered as a component of depreciation rates pursuant to PSCW and FERC orders. Accretion and depreciation expenses related to AROs for Alliant Energy’s non-regulated operations are recorded to depreciation and amortization expenses in Alliant Energy’s income statements. Upon settlement of the ARO liability, an entity settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss. Any gains or losses related to AROs for IPL’s and WPL’s regulated operations are recorded to regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets on the balance sheets. Refer to Note 13 for additional discussion of AROs. NOTE 1(k) Debt Issuance and Retirement Costs - Debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, and are deferred and amortized over the expected life of each debt issue, considering maturity dates and, if applicable, redemption rights held by others. Alliant Energy’s non-regulated businesses and Corporate Services expense in the period of retirement any unamortized debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts on debt retired early. Refer to Note 2 for information on regulatory assets related to IPL’s and WPL’s debt retired early or refinanced. NOTE 1(l) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. Allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on historical write-offs, customer arrears and other economic factors within IPL’s and WPL’s service territories. Refer to Note 5(a) for details of allowance for doubtful accounts. NOTE 1(m) Variable Interest Entities - An entity is considered a VIE if its equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or its equity investors lack any of the following characteristics: (1) power, through voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; (2) the obligation to absorb expected losses of the entity; or (3) the right to receive expected benefits of the entity. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. The financial statements did not reflect any VIEs on a consolidated basis. NOTE 1(n) Cash Flows Presentation - Alliant Energy presents cash flows from continuing operations together with cash flows from discontinued operations in its cash flows statements. NOTE 1(o) New Accounting Standards - Revenue Recognition - In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standard providing principles for recognizing revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers with the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard also requires disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect to adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. Upon adoption, the standard can be applied retrospectively to all prior reporting periods presented, or retrospectively with a cumulative effect to the opening retained earnings balance on January 1, 2018. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on their financial condition and results of operations and do not anticipate a significant change in revenue recognition for retail electric and gas sales, which represent the majority of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s revenues. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL continue to evaluate additional impacts of this standard, as well as which transition method will be utilized. Leases - In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standard requiring lease assets and lease liabilities, including operating leases, to be recognized on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The standard also requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect to adopt this standard on January 1, 2019 and are evaluating the impact of this standard on their financial condition and results of operations and expect an increase in assets and liabilities from recognizing operating leases on their balance sheets. Share-based Compensation Award Payments - In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standard intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation award payments and the associated income taxes. This standard changes the accounting for excess tax benefits, whereby such benefits are recognized in the income statement instead of additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. Alliant Energy adopted this standard on January 1, 2016, which resulted in a cumulative effect of a decrease to its deferred tax liabilities and an increase to its January 1, 2016 retained earnings balance of $3.1 million, which is included in “Other” in Alliant Energy’s common equity statement in 2016. NOTE 2. REGULATORY MATTERS Regulatory Assets - At December 31, regulatory assets were comprised of the following items (in millions): A portion of the regulatory assets in the above table are not earning a return. These regulatory assets, but not the respective carrying costs of these regulatory assets, are expected to be recovered from customers in future rates. At December 31, 2016, IPL and WPL had $44 million and $9 million, respectively, of regulatory assets representing past expenditures that were not earning a return. IPL’s regulatory assets that were not earning a return consisted primarily of emission allowances, debt redemption costs, and costs for clean air compliance and wind generation expansion projects. WPL’s regulatory assets that were not earning a return consisted primarily of amounts related to the wholesale portion of under-collected fuel-related costs, which is discussed in Note 1(g), and environmental-related costs. The other regulatory assets reported in the above table either earn a return or the cash has not yet been expended, in which case the assets are offset by liabilities that also do not incur a carrying cost. Tax-related - IPL and WPL record regulatory assets for certain temporary differences (primarily related to utility property, plant and equipment at IPL) that result in a decrease in current rates charged to customers and an increase in future rates charged to customers based on the timing of income tax expense that is used to determine such rates. These temporary differences for IPL include the impacts of qualifying deductions for repairs expenditures, allocation of mixed service costs, and Iowa accelerated tax depreciation, which all contribute to lower current income tax expense during the first part of an asset’s useful life and higher current tax expense during the last part of an asset’s useful life. These regulatory assets will be recovered from customers in the future when these temporary differences reverse resulting in additional current income tax expense used to determine customers’ rates. During 2016, Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s tax-related regulatory assets increased primarily due to property-related differences for qualifying repair expenditures. Pension and other postretirement benefits costs - The IUB and the PSCW have authorized IPL and WPL to record the retail portion of their respective previously unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses, and prior service costs and credits, as regulatory assets in lieu of AOCL on the balance sheets, as these amounts are expected to be recovered in future rates. IPL and WPL also recognize the wholesale portion of their previously unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses, and prior service costs and credits, as regulatory assets on the balance sheets because these amounts are expected to be recovered in rates in future periods under the formula rate structure. These regulatory assets will be increased or decreased as the net actuarial gains or losses, and prior service costs or credits, are subsequently amortized and recognized as a component of net periodic benefit costs. Regulatory assets are also increased or decreased as a result of the annual defined benefit plan measurement process. Pension and OPEB costs are included within the recoverable cost of service component of rates charged to IPL’s and WPL’s customers. The recoverable costs included in customers’ rates are based upon pension and OPEB costs determined in accordance with GAAP and are calculated using different methods for IPL’s and WPL’s respective regulatory jurisdictions. The IUB authorized IPL in its 2009 Test Year Iowa retail electric rate case order to recover from its retail electric customers in Iowa an allocated portion of annual costs equal to a two-year simple average of actual costs incurred during its 2009 Test Year and an estimate of costs for its forward-looking post-Test Year (2010). The PSCW has authorized WPL to recover from its retail electric and gas customers an estimated allocated portion of annual costs equal to the costs expected to be incurred during each test period. IPL and WPL are authorized to recover from their wholesale customers an allocated portion of actual pension costs incurred each year through FERC-approved formula rates. Refer to Note 12(a) for additional details regarding pension and OPEB costs. AROs - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe it is probable that any differences between expenses accrued for legal AROs related to their regulated operations and expenses recovered currently in rates will be recoverable in future rates, and are deferring the differences as regulatory assets. Refer to Note 13 for additional details of AROs. WPL’s electric generating units retired early - In December 2015, WPL retired Nelson Dewey Units 1 and 2 and Edgewater Unit 3. WPL received approval from the PSCW and FERC to reclassify the remaining net book value of these EGUs from property, plant and equipment to a regulatory asset on Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s balance sheets. The remaining net book value is included in WPL’s rate base and WPL is earning a return on the outstanding balance. WPL is currently recovering the remaining net book value of these EGUs from both its retail and wholesale customers over a 10-year period beginning January 1, 2013 pursuant to PSCW and FERC orders. Derivatives - In accordance with IPL’s and WPL’s fuel and natural gas recovery mechanisms, prudently incurred costs from derivative instruments are recoverable from customers in the future after any losses are realized, and gains from derivative instruments are refundable to customers in the future after any gains are realized. Based on these recovery mechanisms, the changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities/assets resulted in comparable changes to regulatory assets/liabilities on the balance sheets. Refer to Note 15 for additional details of derivative assets and derivative liabilities. Emission allowances - IPL entered into forward contracts in 2007 to purchase SO2 emission allowances with vintage years of 2014 through 2017 from various counterparties to meet future CAIR emission reduction standards. Any SO2 emission allowances acquired under these forward contracts could be used to meet requirements under the existing Acid Rain program regulations or the more stringent CAIR emission reduction standards but are not eligible to be used for compliance requirements under CSAPR. In 2011, the EPA issued CSAPR to replace CAIR with an anticipated effective date in 2012. As a result of the issuance of CSAPR, Alliant Energy and IPL concluded in 2011 that the allowances to be acquired under these forward contracts would not be needed by IPL to comply with expected environmental regulations in the future. Alliant Energy and IPL have recorded a regulatory asset for amounts paid under the forward contracts, as well as for the remaining obligation under the forward contracts as a result of concluding the amount is probable of recovery from IPL’s customers. Commodity cost recovery - Refer to Note 1(g) for additional details of IPL’s and WPL’s cost recovery mechanisms. Other - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL assess whether IPL’s and WPL’s regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulations, recent orders by the applicable regulatory agencies, historical treatment of similar costs by the applicable regulatory agencies and regulatory environment changes. Based on these assessments, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe the regulatory assets recognized as of December 31, 2016 in the above table are probable of future recovery. However, no assurance can be made that IPL and WPL will recover all of these regulatory assets in future rates. If future recovery of a regulatory asset ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset will be charged to expense in the period the likelihood of future recovery is less than probable. Regulatory Liabilities - At December 31, regulatory liabilities were comprised of the following items (in millions): Regulatory liabilities related to cost of removal obligations, to the extent expensed through depreciation rates, reduce rate base. A significant portion of the remaining regulatory liabilities are not used to reduce rate base in the revenue requirement calculations utilized in IPL’s and WPL’s respective rate proceedings. Cost of removal obligations - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL collect in rates future removal costs for many assets that do not have associated legal AROs. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL record a regulatory liability for the estimated amounts they have collected in rates for these future removal costs and reduce the regulatory liability for amounts spent on removal activities. IPL’s tax benefit riders - The IUB has approved electric and gas tax benefit riders proposed by IPL, which utilize regulatory liabilities to credit bills of IPL’s Iowa retail electric and gas customers to help offset the impact of rate increases on such customers. Alliant Energy and IPL recognize an offsetting reduction to income tax expense for the after-tax amounts credited to such customers, resulting in no impact to their net income from the electric and gas tax benefit riders. The tax benefit riders regulatory liabilities are related to tax benefits from tax accounting method changes for repairs expenditures, allocation of mixed service costs, allocation of insurance proceeds from floods in 2008, and cost of removal expenditures. In 2016, Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s “IPL’s tax benefit riders” regulatory liabilities decreased by $76 million as follows (in millions): In December 2016, the IUB authorized $68 million and $7 million of regulatory liabilities from tax benefits to be credited to IPL’s retail electric and gas customers’ bills in 2017 through the electric and gas tax benefit riders, respectively. Any remaining tax benefit rider regulatory liabilities are currently expected to be credited to IPL’s retail electric and gas customers’ bills in the future, subject to final review by the IUB. Electric tax benefit rider - Details for IPL’s electric tax benefit rider are as follows (in millions): The IUB authorized IPL to reduce the electric tax benefit rider billing credits on customers’ bills for 2013 through 2016 to recognize the revenue requirement impact of the changes in tax accounting methods related to tangible property and mixed service costs. The revenue requirement adjustment resulted in increases to electric revenues in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s income statements and was recognized through the energy adjustment clause as a reduction of the credits on IPL’s Iowa retail electric customers’ bills from the electric tax benefit rider as follows (in millions): Gas tax benefit rider - Details for IPL’s gas tax benefit rider are as follows (in millions): Electric transmission cost recovery - Refer to Note 1(g) for additional details of IPL’s and WPL’s electric transmission service cost recovery mechanisms. Commodity cost recovery - Refer to Note 1(g) for additional details of IPL’s and WPL’s commodity cost recovery mechanisms. Energy efficiency cost recovery - WPL and IPL collect revenues from their customers to offset certain expenditures they each incur for energy efficiency programs, including state mandated programs and Shared Savings programs. Differences between forecasted costs used to set rates and actual costs for these programs are deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. The PSCW’s order for WPL’s 2015/2016 Test Period electric and gas base rate case authorized energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations for 2016, which contributed to the decrease in Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s “Energy efficiency cost recovery” regulatory liabilities. Utility Rate Cases - WPL’s Wisconsin Retail Electric and Gas Rate Case (2017/2018 Test Period) - In December 2016, WPL received an order from the PSCW authorizing WPL to implement increases in annual retail electric and gas base rates of $9 million and $9 million, respectively, effective January 1, 2017 followed by a freeze of such rates through the end of 2018. The key drivers for the electric and gas base rate increases are recovery of the costs for environmental controls projects at Edgewater and Columbia, and investments in electric and gas distribution systems, including expansion of natural gas pipeline infrastructure. The filing also included utilization of amounts that WPL previously over-recovered from its customers for energy efficiency cost recovery and electric transmission cost recovery, as well as amounts deferred under the return on common equity sharing mechanism for the 2013/2014 Test Period to reduce the requested base rate increases. The order included provisions that require WPL to defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds certain levels in 2017 or 2018. WPL’s Wisconsin Retail Electric and Gas Rate Case (2015/2016 Test Period) - In July 2014, WPL received an order from the PSCW authorizing WPL to maintain retail electric base rates at their then current levels through the end of 2016. The retail electric base rate case included a return of and return of costs for environmental controls projects, generation performance and reliability improvements, other ongoing capital expenditures and an increase in electric transmission service expense. The additional revenue requirement for these cost increases was offset by the impact of changes in the amortization of regulatory liabilities associated with energy efficiency recoveries and increased sales volumes. The order also authorized WPL to implement a $5 million decrease in annual base rates for its retail gas customers effective January 1, 2015 followed by a freeze of such gas base rates through the end of 2016. The order included provisions that required WPL to defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeded certain levels in 2015 or 2016. As of December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy and WPL deferred $6 million of WPL’s 2016 earnings for these provisions, which is included in “Other” in Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s regulatory liabilities tables above. WPL’s Wisconsin Retail Electric and Gas Rate Case (2013/2014 Test Period) - The PSCW’s order for WPL’s 2013/2014 Test Period electric and gas base rate case included provisions that required WPL to defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeded certain levels during 2013 or 2014. As of December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy and WPL deferred $6 million of WPL’s 2013 and 2014 earnings for these provisions, which is included in “Other” in Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s regulatory liabilities tables above. These deferred earnings will be returned to customers as an offset to revenue requirements in 2017 and 2018 as authorized by the PSCW. IPL’s Iowa Retail Electric Rate Settlement Agreement - The IUB approved a settlement agreement in 2014 related to rates charged to IPL’s Iowa retail electric customers. The settlement agreement extended IPL’s Iowa retail electric base rates authorized in its 2009 Test Year rate case through 2016 and provided targeted retail electric customer billing credits of $105 million in aggregate. IPL recorded such billing credits as follows (in millions): WPL’s Retail Fuel-related Rate Filings - The PSCW authorized annual retail electric rate increases for WPL in 2014, 2015 and 2016, resulting from anticipated increases in retail electric fuel-related costs during such periods. Retail fuel-related costs incurred by WPL in 2015 and 2016 were lower than fuel-related costs used to determine rates for such period resulting in an over-collection of fuel-related costs, and retail fuel-related costs incurred by WPL in 2014 were higher than fuel-related costs used to determine rates for such period resulting in an under-collection of fuel-related costs. These fuel-related costs were subject to deferral since they were outside an annual bandwidth of plus or minus 2% of the approved respective annual forecasted fuel-related costs. Details on these rate increases, as well as amounts WPL deferred for the over-collected (included in “Commodity cost recovery” regulatory liabilities) or under-collected (included in “Commodity cost recovery” regulatory assets) fuel-related costs from its retail electric customers are as follows (dollars in millions): NOTE 3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT At December 31, details of property, plant and equipment on the balance sheets were as follows (in millions): (a) In 2016, IPL received approval from MISO to retire Sutherland Unit 3 and currently anticipates retiring this EGU by June 30, 2017. The recovery of the remaining net book value of this EGU is expected to be addressed in IPL’s next retail electric base rate case, which is currently expected to be filed in the second quarter of 2017. (b) Less accumulated amortization of $71.4 million and $65.2 million for WPL as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility is eliminated from WPL upon consolidation and is included in the “Non-regulated Generation, net” line within Alliant Energy’s consolidated property, plant and equipment. (c) Less accumulated depreciation of $46.5 million and $59.0 million for Alliant Energy as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. (d) Less accumulated depreciation of $272.0 million and $252.9 million for Alliant Energy as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Utility - Environmental Controls Project - WPL’s Edgewater Unit 5 - Construction of a scrubber and baghouse at Edgewater Unit 5 began in 2014 and was completed in 2016, which resulted in a transfer of the capitalized project costs from “Construction work in progress” to “Electric plant - Generation in service” in the above table for Alliant Energy and WPL in 2016. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the capitalized project costs for the scrubber and baghouse consisted of capitalized expenditures of $225 million and CWIP of $190 million, and AFUDC of $12 million and $8 million, respectively, for the scrubber and baghouse. The scrubber and baghouse reduce SO2 and mercury emissions at the EGU and are expected to help meet requirements under CSAPR. Natural Gas-Fired Generation Projects - IPL’s Marshalltown Generating Station - IPL is currently constructing Marshalltown, an approximate 650 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle EGU. Construction began in 2014 and is expected to be completed in April 2017. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Alliant Energy and IPL recorded capitalized expenditures for CWIP of $612 million and $453 million, and AFUDC of $68 million and $24 million, respectively, for Marshalltown in “Construction work in progress” in the above table for Alliant Energy and IPL. WPL’s Riverside Expansion - WPL is currently constructing the Riverside expansion, an approximate 730 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle EGU. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed in early 2020. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Alliant Energy and WPL recorded capitalized expenditures for CWIP of $81 million and $2 million, and AFUDC of $2 million and $0, respectively, for the Riverside expansion in “Construction work in progress” in the above table for Alliant Energy and WPL. These capital expenditures exclude any potential impacts from the intent to exercise purchase options by certain WPL electric cooperatives for a partial ownership interest in the Riverside expansion. Wind Generation - IPL’s Expansion of Wind Generation - IPL currently plans to add wind generation to its resources portfolio. In 2016, IPL entered into a turbine supply agreement and made progress payments for a portion of the wind turbines in such agreement in order to qualify for the full level of production tax credits for this new wind generation. IPL anticipates placing certain of the additional wind generation in service in 2019 and 2020. As of December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy and IPL recorded capitalized expenditures for CWIP of $102 million and AFUDC of $1 million for this expansion of wind generation in “Construction work in progress” in the above table for Alliant Energy and IPL. Sales of IPL’s Minnesota Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Assets - In 2015, IPL completed the sale of its Minnesota natural gas distribution assets (primarily related to property, plant and equipment) and received proceeds of $11 million and a promissory note of $2 million. In 2015, IPL completed the sale of its Minnesota electric distribution assets (primarily related to property, plant and equipment) to Southern Minnesota Energy Cooperative, a combined group of various neighboring electric cooperatives, and received proceeds of $129 million. The proceeds from the natural gas distribution assets were used for general corporate purposes and the proceeds from the electric distribution assets were used to reduce cash amounts received from IPL’s sales of accounts receivable program. The premium received over the book value of the property, plant and equipment sold was more than offset by a reduction in tax-related regulatory assets associated with the distribution assets. As a result, Alliant Energy and IPL recorded pre-tax charges of $11 million and $3 million for the Minnesota electric and natural gas distribution asset transactions, respectively, in “Other operation and maintenance” in their income statements in 2015. The electric distribution asset sales agreement includes a wholesale power supply agreement between IPL and Southern Minnesota Energy Cooperative, which was approved by FERC in 2015 and became effective upon the sale of IPL’s Minnesota electric distribution assets. The wholesale power supply agreement contains a five-year termination notice, which may not be given until the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, resulting in a minimum term of 10 years. The agreement remains in effect indefinitely, unless notice to terminate is provided by either party. This wholesale power supply agreement includes standardized pricing mechanisms that are detailed in IPL’s current tariffs accepted by FERC through wholesale rate case proceedings. IPL’s current return on common equity authorized by FERC related to its wholesale electric rates is 10.97%. As a result of IPL’s requirement to supply electricity to Southern Minnesota Energy Cooperative under the wholesale power supply agreement, the sale of the electric distribution assets did not have a significant impact on IPL’s generation plans or operating results. AFUDC - AFUDC represents costs to finance construction additions including a return on equity component and cost of debt component as required by regulatory accounting. The concurrent credit for the amount of AFUDC capitalized is recorded as “Allowance for funds used during construction” in the income statements. The amount of AFUDC generated by equity and debt components was as follows (in millions): AFUDC related to various construction projects was recognized in the income statements as follows (in millions): Non-regulated and Other - The non-regulated and other property, plant and equipment recorded on Alliant Energy’s balance sheets includes the following: Non-regulated Generation - Franklin County Wind Farm - The Franklin County wind farm was placed into service in 2012 and is depreciated using the straight-line method over a 30-year period. Based on an evaluation of the strategic options for the Franklin County wind farm performed in 2016, Alliant Energy concluded it was probable the Franklin County wind farm will be transferred to IPL. As a result, Alliant Energy performed an impairment analysis of such assets in 2016. The impairment analysis evaluated the value of the assets and a reasonable estimate of the amount of costs associated with the Franklin County wind farm that would be allowed for recovery for IPL’s electric rate-making purposes. Based on various analyses, including discounted cash flows projected from the Franklin County wind farm, recently executed PPAs associated with wind generating facilities located near the Franklin County wind farm, and the cost of new wind farms identified through IPL’s planned wind expansion, the value of the Franklin County wind farm assets was determined to be approximately $33 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Alliant Energy concluded such value represents a reasonable estimate of the amount IPL will be allowed for recovery for IPL’s electric rate-making purposes. As a result, in 2016, the carrying amount of the Franklin County wind farm was reduced to such value, resulting in non-cash, pre-tax asset valuation charges of $86 million (after-tax charges of $51 million, or $0.23 per share). In 2016, Alliant Energy recorded such charges as a reduction to “Non-regulated Generation, net” in the above table and charges to “Asset valuation charges for Franklin County wind farm” in its income statement. In February 2017, FERC issued an order approving the transfer of the Franklin County wind farm from AEF to IPL. Alliant Energy and IPL currently expect to complete this transfer in 2017. The final amount to be recovered for IPL’s electric rate-making purposes is expected to be determined by the IUB as part of IPL’s retail electric rate case for the 2016 Test Year, currently anticipated to be filed in the second quarter of 2017, and therefore the final asset valuation charges are subject to change. Sheboygan Falls - Sheboygan Falls was placed into service in 2005 and is depreciated using the straight-line method over a 35-year period. As of December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy recorded $95 million on its balance sheet related to Sheboygan Falls. Corporate Services and Other - Property, plant and equipment related to Corporate Services includes a customer billing and information system for IPL and WPL and other computer software, and the corporate headquarters building located in Madison, Wisconsin. The customer billing and information system is amortized using the straight-line method over a 12-year period. The majority of the remaining software is amortized over a 5-year period. Property, plant and equipment related to Transportation includes a short-line railway in Iowa and a barge terminal on the Mississippi River. The Corporate Services and Other property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over periods ranging from 5 to 30 years. NOTE 4. JOINTLY-OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITY PLANT Under joint ownership agreements with other utilities, IPL and WPL have undivided ownership interests in jointly-owned coal-fired EGUs. Each of the respective owners is responsible for the financing of its portion of the construction costs. KWh generation and operating expenses are primarily divided between the joint owners on the same basis as ownership. IPL’s and WPL’s shares of expenses from jointly-owned coal-fired EGUs are included in the corresponding operating expenses (e.g., electric production fuel, other operation and maintenance, etc.) in their income statements. Information relative to IPL’s and WPL’s ownership interest in these jointly-owned coal-fired EGUs at December 31, 2016 was as follows (dollars in millions): In November 2016, WPL received an order from the PSCW approving amendments to the Columbia joint operating agreement, which allow the co-owners to forgo certain capital expenditures at Columbia (excluding capital expenditures related to the Columbia Unit 2 SCR currently being constructed), resulting in WPL incurring these additional capital expenditures in exchange for a proportional increase in its ownership share of Columbia. Based on the additional capital expenditures WPL currently expects to incur through June 1, 2020, WPL’s ownership interest in Columbia is expected to increase in the future. In December 2016, WPL filed a request with FERC for approval of these amendments to the Columbia joint operating agreement, effective January 1, 2017. WPL currently expects to receive FERC’s decision on these amendments in 2017. In November 2016, various electric cooperatives, which currently have wholesale power supply agreements with WPL, notified WPL of their intent to exercise purchase options for a partial ownership interest in the Riverside expansion. WPL currently expects the exercise of the purchase options to be effective in 2017. NOTE 5. RECEIVABLES NOTE 5(a) Accounts Receivable - Details for accounts receivable included on the balance sheets as of December 31 were as follows (in millions): NOTE 5(b) Sales of Accounts Receivable - IPL maintains a Receivables Agreement whereby it may sell its customer accounts receivables, unbilled revenues and certain other accounts receivables to a third party through wholly-owned and consolidated special purpose entities. IPL pays a monthly fee to the third party that varies based on interest rates, limits on cash proceeds and cash amounts received from the third party. In March 2016, IPL extended through March 2018 the purchase commitment from the third party to which it sells its receivables. The transfers of receivables meet the criteria for sale accounting established by the transfer of financial assets accounting rules. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, IPL received cash proceeds of up to $180 million from the third party in exchange for the receivables sold. Cash proceeds are used by IPL to meet short-term financing needs, and cannot exceed the current limit or amount of receivables available for sale, whichever is less. The limit on cash proceeds as of December 31, 2016 was $150 million, and effective February 2017 the limit on cash proceeds is $125 million. The Receivables Agreement can be terminated by the third party if arrears or write-offs exceed certain levels. IPL was in compliance with all related covenants as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, IPL sold $248.1 million of receivables to the third party, received $21.0 million in cash proceeds and recorded deferred proceeds of $211.1 million. Deferred proceeds represent IPL’s interest in the receivables sold to the third party. At IPL’s request, deferred proceeds are paid to IPL from collections of receivables, after paying any required expenses incurred by the third party and the collection agent. Corporate Services acts as collection agent for the third party and receives a fee for collection services. IPL believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts related to its sales of receivables is a reasonable approximation of credit risk of the customers that generated the receivables. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, IPL’s costs incurred related to the sales of accounts receivable program were not material. Refer to Note 14 for discussion of the fair value of deferred proceeds. IPL’s maximum and average outstanding aggregate cash proceeds (based on daily outstanding balances) related to the sales of accounts receivable program were as follows (in millions): As of December 31, the attributes of IPL’s receivables sold under the Receivables Agreement were as follows (in millions): (a) Changes in cash proceeds are presented in “Sales of accounts receivable” in operating activities in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s cash flows statements. Additional attributes of IPL’s receivables sold under the Receivables Agreement were as follows (in millions): In connection with the implementation of IPL’s new customer billing and information system in 2016, IPL postponed the write-off of customer bills for a portion of 2016, resulting in lower write-offs in 2016 and higher outstanding receivables past due as of December 31, 2016. NOTE 5(c) Whiting Petroleum Tax Sharing Agreement - Prior to an initial public offering of Whiting Petroleum in 2003, Alliant Energy and Whiting Petroleum entered into a tax separation and indemnification agreement pursuant to which Alliant Energy and Whiting Petroleum made certain tax elections. These tax elections had the effect of increasing the tax basis of the assets of Whiting Petroleum’s consolidated tax group based on the sales price of Whiting Petroleum’s shares in the initial public offering. The increase in the tax basis of the assets was included as income in Alliant Energy’s U.S. federal income tax return for the calendar year 2003. Pursuant to the tax separation and indemnification agreement, Whiting Petroleum paid Alliant Energy the final payment of $26 million in 2014, which represented the present value of certain future tax benefits expected to be realized by Whiting Petroleum through future tax deductions. The $26 million received by Alliant Energy is presented in operating activities in its cash flows statement in 2014. NOTE 6. INVESTMENTS NOTE 6(a) Unconsolidated Equity Investments - Alliant Energy’s and WPL’s unconsolidated investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting are as follows (in millions): (a) Alliant Energy currently has the ability to exercise significant influence over ATC’s financial and operating policies through its participation on ATC’s Board of Directors. Refer to Note 18 for information regarding related party transactions with ATC. Summary aggregate financial information from the financial statements of these investments is as follows (in millions): MISO Transmission Owner Return on Equity Complaints - A group of MISO cooperative and municipal utilities previously filed two complaints with FERC requesting a reduction of the base return on equity used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC. In September 2016, FERC issued an order on the first complaint to reduce the base return on equity for the refund period from November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015. In June 2016, a FERC administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the second complaint recommending a reduction of the base return on equity for the refund period from February 12, 2015 through May 11, 2016. A final decision on the second complaint from FERC is currently expected in the first half of 2017. Alliant Energy and WPL have realized a cumulative $24 million of reductions in the amount of equity income from ATC as a result of the two complaints through December 31, 2016, including $9 million, $12 million and $3 million realized in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. WPL’s Noncontrolling Interest and Investment in ATC - Prior to 2014, WPL owned 100% of WPL Transco, which held Alliant Energy’s investment in ATC. In 2014, WPL Transco’s operating agreement was amended to allow ATI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF, to become a member of WPL Transco in addition to WPL. In 2014, ATI began funding capital contributions that WPL Transco made to ATC. WPL Transco’s equity income from ATC and ATC dividends received by WPL Transco were allocated between WPL and ATI based on their respective ownership interests at the time the equity income was generated and at the time of the dividend payments. Prior to the transfer of the investment in ATC to ATI discussed below, WPL consolidated WPL Transco, and ATI’s ownership in WPL Transco was recorded as a noncontrolling interest in total equity on WPL’s balance sheets. In June 2016, WPL received an order from the PSCW requiring WPL to transfer its investment in ATC to Alliant Energy or an Alliant Energy subsidiary by December 31, 2022. On December 31, 2016, pursuant to the PSCW order, WPL Transco was liquidated and WPL transferred its investment in ATC to ATI. In conjunction with the transfer of the investment in ATC, a deferred intercompany tax gain recognized by WPL was assumed by ATI. The impact of WPL’s transfer of the ATC investment, including the assumption of such intercompany tax gain by ATI, was recorded as a net reduction in total equity of $163.6 million on WPL’s balance sheet. WPL’s income statement includes all of the equity earnings from ATC through December 31, 2016, the date of transfer. There were no impacts of this transfer to Alliant Energy’s consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, ATI owns Alliant Energy’s entire investment in ATC. NOTE 6(b) Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Policies - Various life insurance policies cover certain current and former employees and directors. In 2016, certain of Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s company-owned life insurance policies were liquidated. The related proceeds of $31 million and $19 million were recorded in investing activities in Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s cash flow statements, respectively. At December 31, the cash surrender value of these investments was as follows (in millions): NOTE 7. COMMON EQUITY Common Stock Split - On April 20, 2016, Alliant Energy’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one common stock split and a proportionate increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock of Alliant Energy from 240 million shares to 480 million shares to implement the stock split. Alliant Energy shareowners of record at the close of business on May 4, 2016 received one additional share of Alliant Energy common stock for each share held on that date. The proportionate interest that a shareowner owns in Alliant Energy did not change as a result of the stock split. The additional shares were distributed on May 19, 2016 and post-split trading began on May 20, 2016. All Alliant Energy share and per share amounts in this report have been reflected on a post-split basis. Common Share Activity - A summary of Alliant Energy’s common stock activity was as follows: At December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy had a total of 11.3 million shares available for issuance in the aggregate, pursuant to its Amended and Restated OIP, Shareowner Direct Plan and 401(k) Savings Plan. At-the-Market Offering Program - In 2015, Alliant Energy filed a prospectus supplement under which it may sell up to $150 million of its common stock through an at-the-market offering program. In 2015, Alliant Energy issued 4,373,234 shares of common stock through this program and received cash proceeds of $133 million, net of $2 million in fees and commissions. The proceeds from the issuances of common stock were used for general corporate purposes. This at-the-market offering program expired in 2016. Shareowner Direct Plan - Beginning in 2015, Alliant Energy satisfied its requirements under the Shareowner Direct Plan (dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan) by acquiring Alliant Energy common stock through original issue, rather than on the open market. Shareowner Rights Agreement - Alliant Energy has established an amended and restated Shareowner Rights Agreement. The rights under this agreement will only become exercisable if a person or group has acquired, or announced an intention to acquire, 15% or more of Alliant Energy’s outstanding common stock. Each right will initially entitle registered shareowners to purchase from Alliant Energy one-quarter of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock. The rights will be exercisable at an initial price of $55.00 per full share, subject to adjustment. If any shareowner acquires 15% or more of the outstanding common stock of Alliant Energy, each right (subject to limitations) will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right’s then current exercise price, a number of common shares of Alliant Energy or of the acquirer having a market value at the time of twice the right’s per full share exercise price. Alliant Energy’s Board of Directors is authorized to reduce the 15% ownership threshold to not less than 10%. The amended and restated Shareowner Rights Agreement expires in December 2018. Alliant Energy currently has no intention to redeem the Shareowner Rights Agreement and plans to allow it to naturally expire at the end of the term. Dividend Restrictions - Alliant Energy does not have any significant common stock dividend restrictions. IPL and WPL each have common stock dividend restrictions based on applicable regulatory limitations. IPL also has common stock dividend restrictions based on the terms of its outstanding preferred stock. As of December 31, 2016, IPL and WPL were in compliance with all such dividend restrictions. IPL is restricted from paying common stock dividends to its parent company, Alliant Energy, if for any past or current dividend period, dividends on its preferred stock have not been paid, or declared and set apart for payment. IPL has paid all dividends on its preferred stock through 2016. Under the Federal Power Act, IPL may not pay dividends to its parent company in excess of the current amount of its retained earnings. As of December 31, 2016, IPL’s amount of retained earnings that were free of dividend restrictions was $618 million. If IPL’s actual 13-month average common equity ratio (calculated on a financial basis consistent with IPL’s rate cases) falls below 42% of total capitalization, IPL is required to notify the IUB. Pursuant to a December 2016 PSCW order, WPL has a regulatory limitation on distributions to its parent company. WPL is prohibited from paying annual common stock dividends to its parent company in excess of forecasted dividend levels of $126 million in 2017 and $140 million in 2018 if WPL’s actual 13-month average common equity ratio (calculated on a financial basis consistent with WPL’s rate cases) would fall below 51.00% for 2017 or 2018. As of December 31, 2016, WPL’s amount of retained earnings that were free of dividend restrictions was $126 million for 2017. Restricted Net Assets of Subsidiaries - IPL and WPL do not have regulatory authority to lend or advance any amounts to their parent company. As of December 31, 2016, the amount of net assets of IPL and WPL that were not available to be transferred to their parent company, Alliant Energy, in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends without the consent of IPL’s and WPL’s regulatory authorities was $1.6 billion for each. Comprehensive Income - In 2016, 2015 and 2014, Alliant Energy’s other comprehensive income (loss) was $0, $0.2 million and ($0.4) million, respectively; therefore, its comprehensive income was substantially equal to its net income and its comprehensive income attributable to Alliant Energy common shareowners was substantially equal to its net income attributable to Alliant Energy common shareowners for such periods. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, IPL and WPL had no other comprehensive income; therefore their comprehensive income was equal to their net income and their comprehensive income available for common stock was equal to their earnings available for common stock for such periods. NOTE 8. REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK IPL is authorized to issue up to 16,000,000 shares of cumulative preferred stock in aggregate. Information related to the carrying value of IPL’s cumulative preferred stock at December 31 was as follows: On or after March 15, 2018, IPL may, at its option, redeem the 5.1% cumulative preferred stock for cash at a redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the redemption date. The current articles of incorporation of IPL contain a provision that grants the holders of its cumulative preferred stock voting rights to elect two members of IPL’s Board of Directors if preferred dividends equal to six or more quarterly dividend requirements (whether or not consecutive) are in arrears. Such voting rights would not provide the holders of IPL’s preferred stock control of the decision on redemption of IPL’s preferred stock and could not force IPL to exercise its call option. Therefore, IPL’s cumulative preferred stock is presented in total equity on Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s balance sheets in a manner consistent with noncontrolling interests. Refer to Note 14 for information on the fair value of cumulative preferred stock. NOTE 9. DEBT NOTE 9(a) Short-term Debt - Alliant Energy and its subsidiaries maintain committed bank lines of credit to provide short-term borrowing flexibility and back-stop liquidity for commercial paper outstanding. At December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy’s short-term borrowing arrangements included three revolving credit facilities totaling $1 billion ($300 million for Alliant Energy at the parent company level, $300 million for IPL and $400 million for WPL), which expire in December 2018. Information regarding commercial paper classified as short-term debt and back-stopped by the credit facilities was as follows (dollars in millions): Financial Covenants - The credit facility agreements and AEF’s term loan credit agreement each contain a financial covenant, which requires Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL to maintain certain debt-to-capital ratios in order to borrow under the credit facilities and term loan credit agreement. The required debt-to-capital ratios compared to the actual debt-to-capital ratios at December 31, 2016 were as follows: The debt component of the capital ratios includes long- and short-term debt (excluding non-recourse debt and hybrid securities to the extent the total carrying value of such hybrid securities does not exceed 15% of consolidated capital of the applicable borrower), capital lease obligations, certain letters of credit, guarantees of the foregoing and new synthetic leases. Unfunded vested benefits under qualified pension plans and sales of accounts receivable are not included in the debt-to-capital ratios. The equity component of the capital ratios excludes accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). NOTE 9(b) Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt, net as of December 31 was as follows (dollars in millions): (a) Contains optional redemption provisions which, if elected by the issuer at its sole discretion, could require material redemption premium payments by the issuer. The redemption premium payments under these optional redemption provisions are variable and dependent on applicable U.S. Treasury rates at the time of redemption. (b) In 2016, IPL issued $300 million of 3.7% senior debentures due 2046. The proceeds from the issuance were used by IPL to reduce cash amounts received from its sales of accounts receivable program, reduce commercial paper classified as long-term debt by $100 million and for general corporate purposes. (c) In 2016, AEF entered into a $500 million variable-rate term loan credit agreement and used the proceeds from borrowings under this agreement to retire Alliant Energy’s and Franklin County Holdings LLC’s variable-rate term loan credit agreements that matured in 2016, reduce outstanding commercial paper at Alliant Energy and for general corporate purposes. (d) Refer to Note 9(a) for discussion of a financial covenant contained in AEF’s term loan credit agreement. (e) There were no significant sinking fund requirements related to the outstanding long-term debt. Five-Year Schedule of Debt Maturities - At December 31, 2016, debt maturities for 2017 through 2021 were as follows (in millions): Fair Value of Long-term Debt - Refer to Note 14 for information on the fair value of long-term debt outstanding. NOTE 10. LEASES NOTE 10(a) Operating Leases - Various agreements have been entered into related to property, plant and equipment rights that are accounted for as operating leases. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, rental expenses associated with operating leases were not material. At December 31, 2016, future minimum operating lease payments, excluding contingent rentals, were as follows (in millions): NOTE 10(b) Capital Leases - WPL - In 2005, WPL entered into a 20-year agreement with AEF’s Non-regulated Generation business to lease Sheboygan Falls, with an option for two lease renewal periods thereafter. The lease became effective in 2005 when Sheboygan Falls began commercial operation. WPL is responsible for the operation of Sheboygan Falls and has exclusive rights to its output, and the PSCW approved this affiliated lease agreement in 2005. The capital lease asset is amortized using the straight-line method over the 20-year lease term. WPL’s retail and wholesale rates include recovery of the Sheboygan Falls lease payments. Sheboygan Falls lease expenses were included in WPL’s income statements as follows (in millions): At December 31, 2016, WPL’s estimated future minimum capital lease payments for Sheboygan Falls were as follows (in millions): NOTE 11. INCOME TAXES Income Tax Expense (Benefit) - The components of “Income tax expense (benefit)” in the income statements were as follows (in millions): Income Tax Rates - The overall income tax rates shown in the following table were computed by dividing income tax expense (benefit) by income from continuing operations before income taxes. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities - The deferred tax assets and liabilities included on the balance sheets at December 31 arise from the following temporary differences (in millions): Property - Property-related differences were primarily related to accelerated depreciation, including bonus depreciation. In 2015, the PATH Act was enacted. The most significant provisions of the PATH Act for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL relate to the extension of bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures for property incurred through December 31, 2019 and placed in service prior to December 31, 2020. Alliant Energy currently estimates its total bonus depreciation deductions to be claimed on its U.S. federal income tax return for calendar year 2016 will be approximately $350 million ($100 million for IPL and $200 million for WPL). Carryforwards - At December 31, 2016, carryforwards and expiration dates were estimated as follows (in millions): Uncertain Tax Positions - At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no uncertain tax positions or penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions, and interest accrued and tax positions favorably impacting future effective tax rates for continuing operations were not material. As of December 31, 2016, no material changes to unrecognized tax benefits are expected during the next 12 months. Open tax years - Tax years that remain subject to the statute of limitations in the major jurisdictions for each of Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are as follows: (a) The federal tax returns for 2013 and 2014 are effectively settled as a result of participation in the IRS Compliance Assurance Program, which allows Alliant Energy and the IRS to work together to resolve issues related to Alliant Energy’s current tax year before filing its federal income tax return. The statute of limitations for these federal tax returns expires three years from each filing date. (b) The statute of limitations for these Iowa tax returns expires three years from each filing date. (c) The statute of limitations for these Wisconsin combined tax returns expires four years from each filing date. NOTE 12. BENEFIT PLANS NOTE 12(a) Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans - Retirement benefits are provided to substantially all employees through various qualified and non-qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plans (currently closed to new hires), and/or through defined contribution plans (including 401(k) savings plans). Benefits of the non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are based on the plan participant’s years of service, age and compensation. Benefits of the defined contribution plans are based on the plan participant’s years of service, age, compensation and contributions. Certain defined benefit postretirement health care and life benefits are provided to eligible retirees. In general, the retiree health care plans consist of fixed benefit subsidy structures and the retiree life insurance plans are non-contributory. IPL and WPL account for their participation in Alliant Energy and Corporate Services sponsored plans as multiple-employer plans. In IPL’s and WPL’s tables below, the defined benefit pension plans amounts represent those respective amounts for their bargaining unit employees covered under the qualified plans that they sponsor, as well as amounts directly assigned to them related to their current and former non-bargaining employees who are participants in the Alliant Energy and Corporate Services sponsored qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. In IPL’s and WPL’s tables below, the OPEB plans amounts represent respective amounts for their employees, as well as amounts directly assigned to them related to their current and former non-bargaining employees who are participants in the Corporate Services sponsored OPEB plan. Assumptions - The assumptions for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans at the measurement date of December 31 were as follows: Expected rate of return on plan assets - The expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by analysis of projected asset class returns based on the target asset class allocations. A forward-looking building blocks approach is used, and historical returns, survey information and capital market information are reviewed to support the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption. Refer to “Investment Policy and Strategy for Plan Assets” below for additional information related to investment policy, and strategy and mix of assets for the pension and OPEB plans. Life Expectancy - The life expectancy assumption is used in determining the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. This assumption was updated to utilize mortality tables that were released in 2014 by the Society of Actuaries and updated in 2015 and 2016. Net Periodic Benefit Costs (Credits) - The components of net periodic benefit costs (credits) for sponsored defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are included in the tables below (in millions). Net periodic benefit costs are primarily included in “Other operation and maintenance” in the income statements. (a) The expected return on plan assets is based on the expected rate of return on plan assets and the fair value approach to the market-related value of plan assets. (b) Unrecognized prior service costs (credits) for the OPEB plans are amortized over the average future service period to full eligibility of the participants of each plan. (c) Unrecognized net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the plans’ benefit obligations or assets are amortized over the average future service lives of plan participants, except for the Alliant Energy Cash Balance Pension Plan where gains or losses outside the 10% threshold are amortized over the time period the participants are expected to receive benefits. The estimated amortization from “Regulatory assets” and “Regulatory liabilities” on the balance sheets and AOCL on Alliant Energy’s balance sheet into net periodic benefit cost in 2017 is as follows (in millions): Benefit Plan Assets and Obligations - A reconciliation of the funded status of Alliant Energy’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and OPEB plans to the amounts recognized on Alliant Energy’s balance sheets at December 31 was as follows (in millions): A reconciliation of the funded status of IPL’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and OPEB plans to the amounts recognized on IPL’s balance sheets at December 31 was as follows (in millions): A reconciliation of the funded status of WPL’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and OPEB plans to the amounts recognized on WPL’s balance sheets at December 31 was as follows (in millions): Included in the following tables are accumulated benefit obligations, aggregate amounts applicable to defined benefit pension and OPEB plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, as well as defined benefit pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of the December 31 measurement date (in millions): In addition to the amounts recognized in regulatory assets in the above tables for IPL and WPL, regulatory assets were recognized for amounts associated with Corporate Services employees participating in other Alliant Energy sponsored benefit plans that were allocated to IPL and WPL at December 31 as follows (in millions): Estimated Future Employer Contributions and Benefit Payments - Estimated funding for the qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and OPEB plans for 2017 is as follows (in millions): (a) Alliant Energy sponsors several non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover certain current and former key employees of IPL and WPL. Alliant Energy allocates pension costs to IPL and WPL for these plans. In addition, IPL and WPL amounts reflect funding for their non-bargaining employees who are participants in the Alliant Energy and Corporate Services sponsored qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. Expected benefit payments for the qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows (in millions): Investment Policy and Strategy for Plan Assets - Investment policies and strategies employed with respect to assets of defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are to combine both preservation of principal and prudent and reasonable risk-taking to protect the integrity of plan assets, in order to meet the obligations to plan participants while minimizing benefit costs over the long term. It is recognized that risk and volatility are present with all types of investments. However, risk is mitigated at the total fund level through diversification by asset class including U.S. and international equity and fixed income exposure, global asset and risk parity strategies, the number of individual investments, and sector and industry limits. Global asset and risk parity strategies include investments in global equity, global debt, commodities and currencies. Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets - For assets of defined benefit pension plans, the mix among asset classes is controlled by asset allocation targets. Historical performance results and future expectations suggest that equity securities will provide higher total investment returns than debt securities over a long-term investment horizon. Consistent with the goals of meeting obligations to plan participants and minimizing benefit costs over the long-term, the defined benefit pension plans have a long-term investment posture more heavily weighted towards equity holdings. The asset allocation is monitored regularly and appropriate steps are taken as needed to rebalance the assets within the prescribed ranges. An overlay management service is also used to help maintain target allocations and meet liquidity needs. The overlay manager is authorized to use derivative financial instruments to facilitate this service. For separately managed accounts, prohibited investment vehicles include, but may not be limited to, direct ownership of real estate, margin trading, oil and gas limited partnerships and securities of the managers’ firms or affiliate firms. At December 31, 2016, the current target ranges and actual allocations for the defined benefit pension plan assets were as follows: Other Postretirement Benefits Plan Assets - OPEB plan assets are comprised of specific assets within certain defined benefit pension plans (401(h) assets) as well as assets held in VEBA trusts. The investment policy and strategy of the 401(h) assets, except for the WPL 401(h) assets, mirrors those of the defined benefit pension plans, which are discussed above. For VEBA trusts with assets greater than $5 million and the WPL 401(h) assets, the mix among asset classes is controlled by allocation targets. The asset allocation is monitored regularly and appropriate steps are taken as needed to rebalance the assets within the prescribed ranges. Mutual funds are used to achieve the desired diversification. At December 31, 2016, the current target ranges and actual allocations for VEBA trusts with assets greater than $5 million and the WPL 401(h) assets were as follows: Fair Value Measurements - Fair value measurement accounting establishes three levels of fair value hierarchy that prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Refer to Note 14 for discussion of levels within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 items include investments in securities held in registered investment companies, treasury bills and directly held equity securities, which are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the securities are traded. Level 2 items include fixed income securities consisting of corporate and government bonds and agency obligations, which are valued at the closing price reported in the active market for similar assets in which the individual securities are traded or based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. These fair value amounts are included in the tables below to reconcile the fair value hierarchy to the respective total plan assets. At December 31, the fair values of Alliant Energy’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plan assets were as follows (in millions): At December 31, the fair values of IPL’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plan assets were as follows (in millions): At December 31, the fair values of WPL’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plan assets were as follows (in millions): At December 31, the fair values of Alliant Energy’s OPEB plan assets were as follows (in millions): At December 31, the fair values of IPL’s OPEB plan assets were as follows (in millions): At December 31, the fair values of WPL’s OPEB plan assets were as follows (in millions): For the various defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, Alliant Energy common stock represented less than 1% of assets directly held in the plans at December 31, 2016 and 2015. 401(k) Savings Plans - A significant number of employees participate in defined contribution retirement plans (401(k) savings plans). Alliant Energy common stock directly held by participants represented 12.6% and 11.6% of total assets in the 401(k) savings plans at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Costs related to the 401(k) savings plans, which are partially based on the participants’ contributions and include allocated costs associated with Corporate Services employees for IPL and WPL, were as follows (in millions): Voluntary Employee Separation Charges - In 2015, Alliant Energy offered certain employees a voluntary separation package. Approximately 2% of total Alliant Energy employees accepted this package, which resulted in Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL recording charges of $8 million, $5 million and $3 million, respectively, in 2015. NOTE 12(b) Equity-based Compensation Plans - All shares, units and awards included below have been adjusted to reflect the common stock split discussed in Note 7. In 2015, Alliant Energy’s shareowners approved the Amended and Restated OIP, which permits the grant of shares of Alliant Energy common stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and other stock-based or cash-based awards to key employees. At December 31, 2016, performance shares, performance-contingent restricted stock and restricted stock units (performance- and time-based) were outstanding under the Amended and Restated OIP, and 7.4 million shares of Alliant Energy’s common stock remained available for grants under the Amended and Restated OIP. Alliant Energy satisfies share payouts related to equity awards under the Amended and Restated OIP through the issuance of new shares of its common stock. Alliant Energy also has the DLIP, which permits the grant of cash-based long-term performance-based awards, including performance units, restricted cash awards and restricted units, to certain key employees. At December 31, 2016, performance units, performance-contingent cash awards and restricted units (performance- and time-based) were outstanding under the DLIP. There is no limit to the number of grants that can be made under the DLIP and Alliant Energy satisfies all payouts under the DLIP through cash payments. Nonvested awards generally do not have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents when dividends are paid to common shareowners. A summary of compensation expense, including amounts allocated to IPL and WPL, and the related income tax benefits recognized for share-based compensation awards was as follows (in millions): As of December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation awards was $5.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of between 1 and 2 years. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods and is primarily recorded in “Other operation and maintenance” in the income statements. Performance Shares and Performance Units - Payouts of performance shares under the Amended and Restated OIP and performance units under the DLIP to key employees are contingent upon achievement over three-year periods of specified performance criteria, which currently include metrics of total shareowner return relative to an investor-owned utility peer group. Performance shares can be paid out in shares of Alliant Energy’s common stock, cash or a combination of cash and stock. Performance units must be paid out in cash. Alliant Energy assumes it will make future payouts of its performance shares and performance units in cash; therefore, performance shares and performance units are accounted for as liability awards. A summary of the performance shares and performance units activity, with amounts representing the target number of awards, was as follows: Granted Awards - Each performance share’s value is based on the closing market price of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock at the end of the performance period. For performance units granted in 2016, the value is based on the closing market price of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock at the end of the performance period. For performance units granted in 2015 and 2014, each performance unit’s value is based on the closing market price of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock on the grant date of the award. The actual payout for performance shares and performance units is dependent upon actual performance and may range from zero to 200% of the target number of awards. Compensation expense for performance shares and performance units is recorded ratably over the performance period based on the fair value of the awards at each reporting period. Vested Awards - Certain performance shares and performance units vested, resulting in payouts (a combination of cash and common stock for the performance shares and cash only for the performance units) as follows: Fair Value of Awards - Information related to fair values of nonvested performance shares and performance units at December 31, 2016, by year of grant, were as follows: Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock - Vesting of performance-contingent restricted stock grants is based on the achievement of certain performance targets (currently specified growth of consolidated income from continuing operations). If performance targets are not met within the performance period, which currently ranges from two to four years, these restricted stock grants are forfeited. The fair value of performance-contingent restricted stock is based on the closing market price on the grant date. A summary of the performance-contingent restricted stock activity was as follows: (a) In 2015, 98,186 performance-contingent restricted shares granted in 2013 vested because the specified performance criteria for such shares were met. In 2014, 91,224 and 90,470 performance-contingent restricted shares granted in 2012 and 2011, respectively, vested because the specified performance criteria for such shares were met. (b) The forfeitures during 2014 were primarily caused by retirements and terminations of participants. Performance Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Units - Alliant Energy granted new types of share-based compensation awards to key employees in 2016 referred to as performance restricted stock units under the Amended and Restated OIP, and performance restricted units and key employee performance restricted units under the DLIP. Payouts of these units are based on the achievement of certain performance targets (currently specified growth of consolidated income from continuing operations) during a three-year performance period. The actual number of units that will be paid out upon vesting is dependent upon actual performance and may range from zero to 200% of the target number of units. If performance targets are not met during the performance period, these units are forfeited. As of December 31, 2016, the amount of nonvested performance restricted units and key employee performance restricted units was not material. Performance Restricted Stock Units - Performance restricted stock units generally must be paid out in shares and are accounted for as equity awards. Each performance restricted stock unit’s value is based on the closing market price of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock on the grant date of the award. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the performance period based on a probability assessment of payouts for the awards at each reporting period. A summary of the performance restricted stock units activity, with amounts representing the target number of units, was as follows: Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Units - Alliant Energy granted new types of share-based compensation awards to key employees in 2016 referred to as restricted stock units under the Amended and Restated OIP and restricted units under the DLIP. Payouts of these units are based on the expiration of a three-year time-vesting period. Each restricted stock unit’s value is based on the closing market price of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock at the end of the time-vesting period. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the performance period based on the fair value of the awards at each reporting period. Restricted stock units can be paid out in shares of Alliant Energy common stock, cash or a combination of cash and stock. Alliant Energy assumes it will make future payouts of its restricted stock units in cash; therefore, restricted stock units are accounted for as liability awards. As of December 31, 2016, the amount of nonvested restricted units was not material. A summary of the restricted stock units activity was as follows: Performance-Contingent Cash Awards - Performance-contingent cash award payouts to key employees are based on the achievement of certain performance targets (currently specified growth of consolidated income from continuing operations). If performance targets are not met within the performance period, which currently ranges from two to four years, there are no payouts for these awards. Each performance-contingent cash award’s value is based on the price of one share of Alliant Energy’s common stock at the end of the performance period. Alliant Energy accounts for performance-contingent cash awards as liability awards because payouts will be made in the form of cash. A summary of the performance-contingent cash awards activity was as follows: (a) In 2015, 74,664 performance-contingent cash awards granted in 2013 vested, resulting in cash payouts valued at $2.4 million. In 2014, 69,532 and 41,502 performance-contingent cash awards granted in 2012 and 2011 vested, resulting in cash payouts valued at $1.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively. NOTE 12(c) Deferred Compensation Plan - Alliant Energy maintains a DCP under which key employees may defer up to 100% of base salary and short-term cash incentive compensation and directors may elect to defer all or part of their retainer and committee fees. Key employees who have made the maximum allowed contribution to the Alliant Energy 401(k) Savings Plan may receive an additional credit to the DCP. Key employees and directors may elect to have their deferrals credited to a company stock account, an interest account or equity accounts based on certain benchmark funds. Company Stock Accounts - The DCP does not permit diversification of deferrals credited to the company stock account and all distributions from participants’ company stock accounts are made in the form of shares of Alliant Energy common stock. The deferred compensation obligations for participants’ company stock accounts are recorded in “Additional paid-in capital” and the shares of Alliant Energy common stock held in a rabbi trust to satisfy this obligation are recorded in “Shares in deferred compensation trust” on Alliant Energy’s balance sheets. At December 31, the carrying value of the deferred compensation obligation for the company stock accounts and the shares in the deferred compensation trust based on the historical value of the shares of Alliant Energy common stock contributed to the rabbi trust, and the fair market value of the shares held in the rabbi trust were as follows (in millions): Interest and Equity Accounts - Distributions from participants’ interest and equity accounts are in the form of cash payments. The deferred compensation obligations for participants’ interest and equity accounts are recorded in “Pension and other benefit obligations” on Alliant Energy’s and IPL’s balance sheets. At December 31, the carrying value of deferred compensation obligations for participants’ interest and equity accounts, which approximates fair market value, was as follows (in millions): NOTE 13. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Recognized AROs relate to legal obligations for the removal, closure or dismantlement of several assets including, but not limited to, ash ponds, wind farms, active ash landfills, certain coal yards and above ground storage tanks. Recognized AROs also include legal obligations for the management and final disposition of asbestos, lead-based paint and polychlorinated biphenyls. AROs are recorded in “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on the balance sheets. Refer to Note 2 for information regarding regulatory assets related to AROs. A reconciliation of the changes in AROs associated with long-lived assets is as follows (in millions): (a) In April 2015, the EPA published the final CCR Rule, which regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste and was effective October 2015. IPL and WPL have nine and three coal-fired EGUs, respectively, with coal ash ponds that are impacted by this rule. In addition, IPL and WPL have four and two active CCR landfills, respectively, that are impacted by this rule. In 2015, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL recognized additional AROs of $87 million, $67 million and $20 million, respectively, as a result of the final CCR Rule. These increases in AROs resulted in corresponding increases in property, plant and equipment, net on the respective balance sheets. Actual costs resulting from the CCR Rule may be different than the amounts recorded in 2015 due to potential changes in compliance strategies that will be used, as well as other potential cost estimate changes. Expenditures incurred by IPL and WPL to comply with the CCR Rule are anticipated to be recovered in rates from their customers. In addition, certain AROs related to EGU assets have not been recognized. Due to an indeterminate remediation date, the fair values of the AROs for these assets cannot be currently estimated. A liability for these AROs will be recorded when fair value is determinable. Removal costs of these EGUs are being recovered in rates and are recorded in regulatory liabilities. NOTE 14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Valuation Hierarchy - Fair value measurement accounting establishes three levels of fair value hierarchy that prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1 pricing inputs are quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Level 2 pricing inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active as of the reporting date. Level 3 pricing inputs are unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities for which little or no market data exist and require significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. Valuation Techniques - Derivative assets and derivative liabilities - Derivative instruments are used for risk management purposes to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in certain commodity prices, transmission congestion costs and rail transportation costs. Risk policies are maintained that govern the use of such derivative instruments. Derivative instruments were not designated as hedging instruments and included the following: Swap, option and physical forward commodity contracts were non-exchange-based derivative instruments and were valued using indicative price quotations from a pricing vendor that provides daily exchange forward price settlements, from broker or dealer quotations, from market publications or from on-line exchanges. The indicative price quotations reflected the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices and were obtained from sources believed to provide the most liquid market for the commodity. A portion of these indicative price quotations were corroborated using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and categorized derivative instruments based on such indicative price quotations as Level 2. Commodity contracts that were valued using indicative price quotations based on significant assumptions such as seasonal or monthly shaping and indicative price quotations that could not be readily corroborated were categorized as Level 3. Swap, option and physical forward commodity contracts were predominately at liquid trading points. FTRs were valued using auction prices and were categorized as Level 3. Refer to Note 15 for additional details of derivative assets and derivative liabilities. Deferred proceeds (sales of receivables) - The fair value of IPL’s deferred proceeds related to its sales of accounts receivable program was calculated each reporting date using the cost approach valuation technique. The fair value represents the carrying amount of receivables sold less the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with the receivables sold and cash amounts received from the receivables sold due to the short-term nature of the collection period. These inputs were considered unobservable and deferred proceeds were categorized as Level 3. Deferred proceeds represent IPL’s maximum exposure to loss related to the receivables sold. Refer to Note 5(b) for additional information regarding deferred proceeds. Long-term debt (including current maturities) - The fair value of long-term debt instruments was based on quoted market prices for similar liabilities at each reporting date or on a discounted cash flow methodology, which utilizes assumptions of current market pricing curves at each reporting date, and was substantially classified as Level 2. Refer to Note 9(b) for additional information regarding long-term debt. Cumulative preferred stock - The fair value of IPL’s 5.1% cumulative preferred stock was based on its closing market price quoted by the New York Stock Exchange at each reporting date, and was classified as Level 1. Refer to Note 8 for additional information regarding cumulative preferred stock. Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of such financial instruments. Carrying amounts and the related estimated fair values of other financial instruments at December 31 were as follows (in millions): Information for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) was as follows (in millions): (a) Settlements related to deferred proceeds are due to the change in the carrying amount of receivables sold less the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with the receivables sold and cash amounts received from the receivables sold. Commodity Contracts - The fair value of electric, natural gas and coal commodity contracts categorized as Level 3 was recognized as net derivative assets (liabilities) at December 31 as follows (in millions): NOTE 15. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Commodity Derivatives - Purpose - Derivative instruments are used for risk management purposes to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in certain commodity prices and transmission congestion costs. Refer to Note 14 for detailed discussion of derivative instruments. Notional Amounts - As of December 31, 2016, gross notional amounts and settlement/delivery years related to outstanding swap contracts, option contracts, physical forward contracts, FTRs, coal contracts and diesel fuel contracts that were accounted for as commodity derivative instruments were as follows (units in thousands): Financial Statement Presentation - Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value each reporting date on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities. At December 31, the fair values of current derivative assets are included in “Other current assets,” non-current derivative assets are included in “Deferred charges and other,” current derivative liabilities are included in “Other current liabilities” and non-current derivative liabilities are included in “Other liabilities” on the balance sheets as follows (in millions): Unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments are generally recorded with offsets to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities, based on fuel and natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, as well as other specific regulatory authorizations. Based on these recovery mechanisms, the changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities resulted in comparable changes to regulatory assets, and the changes in the fair value of derivative assets resulted in comparable changes to regulatory liabilities. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion. Credit Risk-related Contingent Features - Various agreements contain credit risk-related contingent features, including requirements to maintain certain credit ratings and/or limitations on liability positions under the agreements based on credit ratings. Certain of these agreements with credit risk-related contingency features are accounted for as derivative instruments. In the event of a material change in creditworthiness or if liability positions exceed certain contractual limits, credit support may need to be provided in the form of letters of credit or cash collateral up to the amount of exposure under the contracts, or the contracts may need to be unwound and underlying liability positions paid. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was not materially different than amounts that would be required to be posted as credit support to counterparties by Alliant Energy, IPL or WPL if the most restrictive credit risk-related contingent features for derivative agreements in a net liability position were triggered. Balance Sheet Offsetting - The fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to a master netting arrangement are not netted by counterparty on the balance sheets. However, if the fair value amounts of derivative instruments by counterparty were netted, amounts would not be materially different from gross amounts of derivative assets and derivative liabilities at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (payable) are not offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES NOTE 16(a) Capital Purchase Obligations - Various contractual obligations contain minimum future commitments related to capital expenditures for certain construction projects. IPL’s projects include the installation of an SCR system at Ottumwa Unit 1 to reduce NOx emissions at the EGU. WPL’s projects include the Riverside expansion, generation maintenance and performance improvements at Columbia Units 1 and 2, and the installation of an SCR system at Columbia Unit 2 to reduce NOx emissions at the EGU. At December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s minimum future commitments related to certain contractual obligations for these projects were $58 million, $3 million and $55 million, respectively. NOTE 16(b) Operating Expense Purchase Obligations - Various commodity supply, transportation and storage contracts help meet obligations to provide electricity and natural gas to utility customers. Other operating expense purchase obligations with various vendors provide other goods and services. At December 31, 2016, minimum future commitments related to these operating expense purchase obligations were as follows (in millions): (a) Includes payments required by PPAs for capacity rights and minimum quantities of MWhs required to be purchased. (b) Corporate Services entered into system-wide coal contracts on behalf of IPL and WPL that include minimum future commitments. These commitments were assigned to IPL and WPL based on information available as of December 31, 2016 regarding expected future usage, which is subject to change. (c) Includes individual commitments incurred during the normal course of business that exceeded $1 million at December 31, 2016. Certain contracts are considered leases and are therefore not included here, but are included in Note 10. NOTE 16(c) Legal Proceedings - Flood Damage Claims - In 2013, several plaintiffs purporting to represent a class of residential and commercial property owners filed a complaint against CRANDIC, Alliant Energy and various other defendants in the Iowa District Court for Linn County. Plaintiffs assert claims of negligence and strict liability based on their allegations that CRANDIC (along with other defendants) caused or exacerbated flooding of the Cedar River in June 2008. In February 2016, the Iowa District Court for Linn County ruled in favor of Alliant Energy and CRANDIC and dismissed all claims against them, resulting in no loss. In August 2016, the Iowa District Court for Linn County dismissed all claims against the remaining defendants. In September 2016, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Iowa. Alliant Energy does not currently believe any material losses for this complaint are both probable and reasonably estimated, and therefore has not recognized any material loss contingency amounts as of December 31, 2016. Other - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are involved in other legal and administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although unable to predict the outcome of these matters, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe that appropriate reserves have been established and final disposition of these actions will not have a material effect on their financial condition or results of operations. NOTE 16(d) Guarantees and Indemnifications - RMT - In 2013, Alliant Energy sold RMT. RMT provided renewable energy services, including construction and high voltage connection services for wind and solar projects. As part of the sale, Alliant Energy indemnified the buyer for any claims, including claims of warranty under the project obligations that were commenced or are based on actions that occurred prior to the sale, except for liabilities already accounted for through adjustments to the purchase price. In 2016, the indemnification obligations and contractual warranty periods expired; however, limited warranties may be extended in certain cases for warranty work performed. Alliant Energy also continues to guarantee RMT’s performance obligations related to certain of RMT’s projects that were commenced prior to Alliant Energy’s sale of RMT. As of December 31, 2016, Alliant Energy had $75 million of performance guarantees outstanding, which are currently expected to expire in 2017. The expiration of these performance guarantees may be extended depending on when all valid warranty claims are resolved for the respective projects. Although Alliant Energy has received warranty claims related to certain of these projects, it does not currently believe that material losses are both probable and reasonably estimated, and therefore, has not recognized any material liabilities related to these matters as of December 31, 2016. Alliant Energy does not currently believe that the range of future potential loss from any warranty claims will be material. Refer to Note 19 for further discussion of RMT, including amounts Alliant Energy recorded to “Operating expenses” in 2016, 2015 and 2014 related to certain warranty claims. Whiting Petroleum - In 2004, Alliant Energy sold its remaining interest in Whiting Petroleum. Whiting Petroleum is an independent oil and gas company. Alliant Energy Resources, LLC, as the successor to a predecessor entity that owned Whiting Petroleum, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEF, continues to guarantee the partnership obligations of an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum under general partnership agreements in the oil and gas industry, including with respect to the future abandonment of certain platforms off the coast of California and related onshore plant and equipment owned by the partnerships. The guarantees do not include a maximum limit. As of December 31, 2016, the present value of the abandonment obligations is estimated at $31 million. Alliant Energy is not aware of any material liabilities related to these guarantees of which it is probable that Alliant Energy Resources, LLC will be obligated to pay and therefore has not recognized any material liabilities related to this guarantee as of December 31, 2016. IPL’s Minnesota Electric Distribution Assets - IPL provided indemnifications associated with the July 2015 sale of its Minnesota electric distribution assets for losses resulting from potential breach of IPL’s representations, warranties and obligations under the sale agreement. Alliant Energy and IPL believe the likelihood of having to make any material cash payments under these indemnifications is remote. IPL has not recorded any material liabilities related to these indemnifications as of December 31, 2016. The general terms of the indemnifications provided by IPL included a maximum limit of $17 million and expire in October 2020. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of the sale of IPL’s Minnesota electric distribution assets. NOTE 16(e) Environmental Matters - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to environmental regulations as a result of their current and past operations. These regulations are designed to protect public health and the environment and have resulted in compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations, which are recorded as current and non-current environmental liabilities. Substantially all of the environmental liabilities recorded on the balance sheets relate to MGP sites. MGP Sites - IPL and WPL have current or previous ownership interests in various sites that are previously associated with the production of gas for which IPL and WPL have, or may have in the future, liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs. IPL and WPL are working pursuant to the requirements of various federal and state agencies to investigate, mitigate, prevent and remediate, where necessary, the environmental impacts to property, including natural resources, at and around these former MGP sites in order to protect public health and the environment. Environmental liabilities related to these MGP sites are recorded based upon periodic studies. Such amounts are based on the best current estimate of the remaining amount to be incurred for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs for those sites where the investigation process has been or is substantially completed, and the minimum of the estimated cost range for those sites where the investigation is in its earlier stages. There are inherent uncertainties associated with the estimated remaining costs for MGP projects primarily due to unknown site conditions and potential changes in regulatory agency requirements. It is possible that future cost estimates will be greater than current estimates as the investigation process proceeds and as additional facts become known. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted. At December 31, 2016, estimated future costs expected to be incurred for the investigation, remediation and monitoring of the MGP sites, as well as environmental liabilities recorded on the balance sheets for these sites, were as follows (in millions). At December 31, 2016, such amounts for WPL were not material. Refer to Note 2 for discussion of regulatory assets recorded by IPL and WPL, which reflect the probable future rate recovery of MGP expenditures. Considering the current rate treatment, and assuming no material change therein, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe that the clean-up costs incurred for these MGP sites will not have a material effect on their financial condition or results of operations. WPL Consent Decree - In 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin approved a Consent Decree that WPL, along with the other owners of Edgewater and Columbia, entered into with the EPA and the Sierra Club, thereby resolving claims against WPL. Such claims included allegations that the owners of Edgewater, Nelson Dewey and Columbia violated the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program requirements, Title V Operating Permit requirements of the CAA and the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan designed to implement the CAA. WPL has completed various requirements under the Consent Decree. WPL’s remaining requirements include installing an SCR system at Columbia Unit 2 and fuel switching or retiring Edgewater Unit 4 by December 31, 2018. The Consent Decree also establishes SO2, NOx and particulate matter emission rate limits for Columbia Units 1 and 2, and Edgewater Units 4 and 5. In addition, the Consent Decree includes annual plant-wide SO2 and NOx emission caps for Columbia and Edgewater. WPL is in the process of completing approximately $7 million in environmental mitigation projects. Alliant Energy and WPL currently expect to recover material costs incurred by WPL related to compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree from WPL’s electric customers. IPL Consent Decree - In 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa approved a Consent Decree that IPL entered into with the EPA, the Sierra Club, the State of Iowa and Linn County in Iowa, thereby resolving potential CAA issues associated with emissions from IPL’s coal-fired generating facilities in Iowa. IPL has completed various requirements under the Consent Decree. IPL’s remaining requirements include installing an SCR system or equivalent NOx reduction system at the Ottumwa Generating Station by December 31, 2019; fuel switching or retiring Prairie Creek Unit 4 by June 1, 2018, the Burlington Generating Station by December 31, 2021 and Prairie Creek Units 1 and 3 by December 31, 2025; and either installing combined cycle technology at, or retiring, the Dubuque and Sutherland Generating Stations by June 1, 2019. The Consent Decree also establishes SO2, NOx and particulate matter emission rate limits with varying averaging times for the Burlington, Lansing, M.L. Kapp, Ottumwa and Prairie Creek Generating Stations. In addition, the Consent Decree includes calendar-year SO2 and NOx emission caps for the Prairie Creek Generating Station, and calendar-year SO2 and NOx emission caps in aggregate for the Burlington, Dubuque, Lansing, M.L. Kapp, Ottumwa, Prairie Creek and Sutherland Generating Stations. IPL is in the process of completing approximately $6 million in environmental mitigation projects. Alliant Energy and IPL currently expect to recover material costs incurred by IPL related to the environmental control systems and environmental mitigation projects from IPL’s electric customers. Other Environmental Contingencies - In addition to the environmental liabilities discussed above, various environmental rules are monitored that may have a significant impact on future operations. Several of these environmental rules are subject to legal challenges, reconsideration and/or other uncertainties. Given uncertainties regarding the outcome, timing and compliance plans for these environmental matters, the complete financial impact of each of these rules is not able to be determined; however future capital investments and/or modifications to EGUs to comply with certain of these rules could be significant. Specific current, proposed or potential environmental matters include, among others: CSAPR, Effluent Limitation Guidelines, CCR Rule, and various legislation and EPA regulations to monitor and regulate the emission of GHG, including carbon emissions from new (CAA Section 111(b)) and existing (CAA Section 111(d)) fossil-fueled EGUs. NOTE 16(f) Credit Risk - IPL and WPL provide regulated electricity and natural gas services to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale customers in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois for IPL and Wisconsin for WPL. The geographic concentration of these customers did not contribute significantly to overall credit risk exposure. In addition, as a result of a diverse customer base, IPL and WPL did not have any significant credit risk concentration for receivables arising from the sale of electricity or natural gas services. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to credit risk related to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities and other goods or services at the contracted price. Credit policies are maintained to mitigate credit risk. These credit policies include evaluation of the financial condition of certain counterparties, use of credit risk-related contingent provisions in certain agreements that require credit support from counterparties not meeting specific criteria, diversification of counterparties to reduce concentrations of credit risk and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with certain counterparties. Based on these credit policies and counterparty diversification, as well as utility cost recovery mechanisms, it is unlikely that counterparty non-performance would have a material effect on financial condition or results of operations. However, there is no assurance that these items will protect against all losses from counterparty non-performance. Refer to Notes 5(a) and 15 for details of allowances for doubtful accounts and credit risk-related contingent features, respectively. NOTE 16(g) Collective Bargaining Agreements - At December 31, 2016, employees covered by collective bargaining agreements represented 56%, 65% and 81% of total employees of Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL, respectively. In August 2017, IPL’s collective bargaining agreement with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 204 (Cedar Rapids) expires, representing 19% and 46% of total employees of Alliant Energy and IPL, respectively. NOTE 17. SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS Alliant Energy - Alliant Energy’s principal businesses as of December 31, 2016 are: • Utility - includes the operations of IPL and WPL, which primarily serve retail customers in Iowa and Wisconsin. The utility business has three reportable segments: a) utility electric operations, which include Alliant Energy’s investment in ATC; b) utility gas operations; and c) utility other, which includes steam operations and the unallocated portions of the utility business. Various line items in the following tables are not allocated to the electric and gas segments for management reporting purposes, and therefore, are included only in “Total Utility.” • Non-regulated, Parent and Other - includes the operations of AEF and its subsidiaries, Corporate Services, the Alliant Energy parent company, and any Alliant Energy parent company consolidating adjustments. AEF’s businesses include Transportation, Non-regulated Generation and other non-regulated investments described in Note 1(a).

RELATED PARTIES Service Agreements - IPL and WPL are parties to service agreements with an affiliate, Corporate Services. Pursuant to these service agreements, IPL and WPL receive various administrative and general services. These services are billed to IPL and WPL at cost based on expenses incurred by Corporate Services for the benefit of IPL and WPL, respectively. These costs consisted primarily of employee compensation and benefits, fees associated with various professional services, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, and a return on net assets. Corporate Services also acts as agent on behalf of IPL and WPL pursuant to the service agreements. As agent, Corporate Services enters into energy, capacity, ancillary services, and transmission sale and purchase transactions within MISO. Corporate Services assigns such sales and purchases among IPL and WPL based on statements received from MISO. The amounts billed for services provided, sales credited and purchases were as follows (in millions): As of December 31, net intercompany payables to Corporate Services were as follows (in millions): ATC - Pursuant to various agreements, WPL receives a range of transmission services from ATC. WPL provides operation, maintenance, and construction services to ATC. WPL and ATC also bill each other for use of shared facilities owned by each party.

            " WUNONG ASIA PACIFIC COMPANY LIMITED INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Wunong Asia Pacific Co. Ltd, Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Wunong Asia Pacific Co. Ltd. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficits and statements of cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of Wunong Asia Pacific Co. Ltd. as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Emphasis of Matter - Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations, it has not yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Yu Certified Public Accountant PC We have served as the Company's auditor since 2019.

WUNONG ASIA PACIFIC COMPANY LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 (Currency expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”), except for number of shares) 1.ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND Wunong Asia Pacific Company Limited (fka Panama Dreaming Inc.) (“Asia Pacific” or the “Company” or “we” or “us”), have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Asia Pacific was incorporated in Nevada on June 23, 2011 for the purpose of offering real estate consulting services to persons located in North America who are interested in investing in real estate located in Panama. On November 5, 2012, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State to change its name from “Panama Dreaming Inc.” to “Asia Pacific Boiler Corporation”, to be effected by way of a merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary Asia Pacific Boiler Corporation, which was created solely for the name change. Also on November 5, 2012, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Nevada Secretary of State to give effect to a forward split of its authorized, issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a 4 new for 1 old basis and, consequently, the Company’s authorized common stock increased from 100,000,000 to 400,000,000 shares, and the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares increased from 7,950,000 to 31,800,000, all with a par value of $0.00001. The Company’s preferred stock remained unchanged with 100,000,000 preferred shares authorized, par value $0.00001, and no preferred shares issued or outstanding. The forward split and name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on November 9, 2012. On November 6, 2014, the Company changed the fiscal year end to December 31 from June 30. These financial statements and this Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2017. Merge with Million Place Investments Ltd. On August 5, 2014, we entered into and closed a share exchange agreement with Million Place Investments Ltd. (“Million Place”) and the shareholders of Million Place. Pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, we agreed to acquire all 10,000 of the issued and outstanding shares of Million Place’s common stock in exchange for the issuance by our company of 7,500,000 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Million Place. As a result of these transactions, Million Place has become our wholly owned subsidiary. We would have 39,300,000 issued and outstanding common shares upon issuance of the 7,500,000 shares of common stock. On November 19, 2015, we authorized and issued the 7,500,000 shares of common stock. Business of Million Place Investments Ltd. Million Place was incorporated on April 30, 2012 under the laws of the British Virgin Island (BVI) to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including but not limited to mergers and acquisitions. Pursuant to a Share Transfer Agreement dated December 3, 2012, Million Place purchased from John Gong, 14.7 million shares at Renminbi (RMB) 1.00 per ordinary share (approximately $2,227,273 in the aggregate) in the share capital of Inner Mongolia Yulong Pump Production Company Limited (Yulong Pump) thereby acquiring an equity interest of 49% in Yulong Pump. Yulong Pump is a China foreign joint venture corporation engaged in the sale and manufacture of industrial equipment, and in the acquisition, development and exploitation of residential, commercial, and industrial real estate assets. The business of Yulong Pump is further described below. In acquiring a 49% interest in Yulong Pump, Million Place became the deemed cooperative foreign joint venture partner of Yulong Pump. WUNONG ASIA PACIFIC COMPANY LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 (Currency expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”), except for number of shares) Pursuant to PRC law, the partners in a cooperative foreign joint venture are permitted to share profits on an agreed basis and not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution. The joint venture is not required to be a distinct legal entity from its partners and management and financial control of the foreign joint venture may be determined at the discretion of the partners by mutual agreement provided that, upon termination of the joint venture, all fixed assets will become the property of the Chinese participant in the joint venture. Pursuant to the December 3, 2012 Share Transfer Agreement, Million Place was entitled to appoint the board of directors of Yulong Pump. Further, absent an agreement between Million Place and Yulong Pump, the articles of association of Yulong Pump provide for distribution of dividends amongst its shareholder in proportion to the number of shares held by them. On April 25, 2015, Million Place entered into a Share Sale &Purchase Agreement with Qin Xiu Shan, our former President, former Chief Executive Officer and former Director, whereby Mr. Qin, who is the beneficial owner of a 51% interest in Yulong Pump, granted to Million Place the option to purchase an additional 2% equity interest in Yulong Pump (being 600,000 shares) for the aggregate purchase price of RMB 1.00 per share or approximately $96,278 in the aggregate. The option is perpetual and without provision for termination. With its acquisition of a 49% equity interest together with an option to purchase an aggregate 51% equity interest, Million Place is seeking to establish a majority equity stake in Yulong Pump. On May 22, 2015, Million Place entered into a Joint Venture Contract with Yulong Pump pursuant to which the companies intend to jointly engage in the manufacture of industrial boilers, the provision of consultancy services for the design of boiler systems, the manufacture of industrial water pumps and accessories, and the acquisition and development of real estate. Pursuant to the Joint Venture Contract, Million Place will be solely responsible all operations and management of the joint venture and shall have exclusive authority to enter into agreements on behalf of the joint venture. Million Place will in turn receive compensation for services it provides to the joint venture and shall be entitled to a 49% share of profit generated by the joint venture. Both Million Place and Yulong Pump shall be entitled to engage in business that is competitive with the joint venture. Pursuant to the Joint Venture Contract, Yulong Pump has allocated its 143,106 square foot commercial property located in Wulateqianqi, Mongolia to the joint venture operation. That property is currently under construction and is further described below. Additional assets or operations may be allocated to the joint venture on an ongoing basis. As of today, the joint venture contract has not been completed. Business of Inner Mongolia Yulong Pump Production Company Limited Inner Mongolia Yulong Pump Production Company Limited (“Yulong Pump”) was incorporated on October 6, 1998 under the laws of the Peoples’ Republic of China to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. In 1998, Yulong Pump paid a total of RMB 799,000 ($131,985) to acquire land use rights in Wuchuan, Inner Mongolia for the purposes of establishing a manufacturing facility where. From 1998 until 2008, Yulong Pump was engaged in the manufacture of industrial water pumps for a variety of applications in Wuchuan, Inner Mongolia. In 2008, Yulong Pump ceased its water pump manufacturing activities due to a decrease in demand for its products and increasing obsolescence of its manufacturing infrastructure. The land use rights for the Wuchuan property expire in 2046 and are eligible for renewal subject to additional costs. The Wuchuan property, is located in the city centre of Wuchuan, a suburb of Hohhot. Yulong pump intends to explore the potential for commercial development of these lands. The land use right has not been transferred to Yulong Pump as of December 31, 2017. Yulong Pump has written off the net amount of land use right as of December 31, 2017. WUNONG ASIA PACIFIC COMPANY LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 (Currency expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”), except for number of shares) Since the termination of its water pump manufacturing operations, Yulong Pump has engaged in the identification and acquisition of other industrial manufacturing assets, and in the acquisition, development and exploitation of residential, commercial, and industrial real estate assets. In 2008, Yulong Pump transformed itself from a local resident China company to a foreign joint venture company. As a result, the Company has become an entity with the status of a foreign joint venture company with registered capital of RMB ¥30 million (approximately USD$4,839,181), which consists of 30 million shares of authorized, issued and outstanding voting common stock with a par value of RMB ¥1.0 per share (USD$0.16). In 2013, Yulong Pump applied to the Foreign Investment Committee of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to raise the registered capital from RMB 30 million to RMB 600 million.(approximately USD$96,783,624). This was approved in November 2013. During the year 2013, Yulong Pump raised RMB188,355,325 (USD$31,114,083) as a contribution from its president and CEO, Qin Xiu San. On August 5, 2013 Yulong Pump entered into Real Estate Sales Contracts (Lease Agreements) with WulateqianqiHua Yuan Real Estate Limited Company pursuant to which Yulong Pump acquired the land use rights, expiring on September 15, 2080, to the third, fourth and fifth floors of a 6 story commercial building under development and located in Wulanteqianqi, Mongolia, China. The leasehold area of the property is approximately 143,106 square feet. Yulong pump paid RMB 188,355,325 (approximately USD $31,114,000) in consideration of the land use rights. The property is under construction with completion anticipated by Fall of 2016. The Wulateqianqi property was subsequently allocated to the joint venture between Million Place and Yulong Pump pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement dated May 22, 2015. Million Place is therefore responsible for the administration and management of the property and entitled to receive 49% of the joint venture proceeds. The parties intend to lease the facility upon completion of construction and a potential tenant has been identified. On February 1, 2015, Yulong Pump entered into a Warranty Deed Agreement with Qin Xiu San, a former officer and former director of the Company, pursuant to which Mr. Qin has agreed to transfer to Yulong Pump by July 31, 2015 all outstanding securities of Hohhot Devotion Boiler General Company Private Limited (“Hohhot Devotion Boiler”). The Warranty Deed Agreement does not provide for financial consideration. Hohhot Devotion Boiler is a PRC company with approximately 300 employees engaged in the manufacture and sale of industrial boilers, and in real estate development in the Hohhot region of Inner Mongolia, China. It is the largest manufacturer of boilers in Inner Mongolia. Together, Devotion Boiler and Yulong Pump are concurrently planning to begin construction in March 2015 of a new state of the art boiler manufacturing factory with a planned investment of approximately USD$250 million. The companies intend to commence staffing and training of the new boiler plant employees concurrently with the start of construction. Yulong Pump and Devotion Boiler also intend to rezone for commercial and residential use industrial land owned by Devotion Boiler in Inner Mongolia. As at the date of this report, the acquisition of Devotion Boiler by Yulong Pump remains incomplete, and there is no guarantee that any such acquisition will be completed. Further, there is no guarantee that Yulong Pump or Devotion Boiler will successfully financing the construction of their planned boiler facility. On August 5, 2015, the warranty deed was extended to October 31, 2015. As at the date of this report, the acquisition has not been completed and our company is seeking a further extension until June 30, 2016. There is no guarantee that the transfer will be completed or that it will be completed on terms favorable to Yulong Pump. Throughout the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, Yulong Pump had no business activities. WUNONG ASIA PACIFIC COMPANY LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 (Currency expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”), except for number of shares) Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Million Place, together with its joint venture partner, Yulong Pump, we adopted a multi-pronged business plan involving the acquisition, development and exploitation of residential, commercial, and industrial real estate assets, the manufacture and sale of industrial water pumps and accessories and industrial boilers, and the provision of consultancy services for the design of industrial boiler systems. Description of subsidiary and associate The Company and its subsidiary are hereinafter referred to as (the “Company”). 2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ●Basis of presentation These accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). ●Use of estimates In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. ●Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company have been eliminated upon consolidation. The Company accounts for the investment in associate in which the Company does not hold a controlling financial interest but have significant influence over operating and financial policies using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is recorded at cost and adjusted for the proportionate share of net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income or loss, cash contributions made and distributions received, and other adjustments, as appropriate. The Company performs a periodic evaluation of an investment to determine whether the fair value of each investment is less than the carrying value, and, if so, whether such decrease in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary. The Company has provided an impairment loss in full to the investment in an associate during 2015 fiscal year. As at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the investment in an associate was reduced to zero. WUNONG ASIA PACIFIC COMPANY LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 (Currency expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”), except for number of shares) ●Net loss per share The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an \"as if converted\" basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding. ●Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the Financial Accounting Standards Board of Financial Accounting Standard ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes ” (“ASC 740”). Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. There was no current or deferred income tax expense or benefits for the periods ending December 31, 2017 and 2016. Income taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions. ●Related parties Parties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operational decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. WUNONG ASIA PACIFIC COMPANY LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 (Currency expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”), except for number of shares) ●Fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments (excluding short-term bank borrowing and convertible promissory notes): cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accounts payable to a related party and advance from a related party approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Management believes, based on the current market prices or interest rates for similar debt instruments, the fair value of its obligation under finance lease and short-term bank borrowing approximate the carrying amount. The Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820-10”), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: · Level 1 : Inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets; · Level 2: Inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. Black-Scholes Option-Pricing model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs; and · Level 3: Inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. ●Recent accounting pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard provides companies with a single model for accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The core principle of the model is to recognize revenue when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer, as opposed to recognizing revenue when the risks and rewards transfer to the customer under the existing revenue guidance. The guidance permits companies to either apply the requirements retrospectively to all prior periods presented, or apply the requirements in the year of adoption, through a cumulative adjustment. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the required adoption date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result of the deferred effective date, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company in its first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date of the new standard of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The following ASUs were subsequently issued by the FASB to clarify the implementation guidance in some areas and add practical expedients: In March 2016, ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations; in April 2016, ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing; in May 2016, ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients; and in December 2016, ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Revenue from Contracts with Customers. WUNONG ASIA PACIFIC COMPANY LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 (Currency expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”), except for number of shares) In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The standard requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in its balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The guidance in ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which changes the accounting for employee share-based payments, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. Under the new guidance, excess tax benefits associated with share-based payment awards will be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or settle, rather than in stockholders’ equity. In addition, it will increase the number of shares an employer can withhold to cover income taxes on share-based payment awards and still qualify for the exemption to liability classification. The guidance was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash, which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for the Company in its first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, but any adjustments must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The new standard must be adopted retrospectively. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, which eliminates step two of the quantitative goodwill impairment test. Step two required determination of the implied fair value of a reporting unit, and then a comparison of this implied fair value with the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit, in order to determine any goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance, an entity is only required to complete a one-step quantitative test, by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and any goodwill impairment charge is determined by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. However, the loss should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2017, and is to be applied on a prospective basis. WUNONG ASIA PACIFIC COMPANY LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 (Currency expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”), except for number of shares) In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the statement of operations. The new guidance requires entities to report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside the subtotal of loss from operations. ASU 2017-07 also provides that only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization. The standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018, with adoption to be applied on a retrospective basis. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting, which provides clarification on when modification accounting should be used for changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. This ASU does not change the accounting for modifications but clarifies that modification accounting guidance should only be applied if there is a change to the value, vesting conditions or award classification and would not be required if the changes are considered non-substantive. The amendments of this ASU are effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which modifies the presentation and disclosure of hedging results. Further, it provides partial relief on the timing of certain aspects of hedge documentation and eliminates the requirement to recognize hedge ineffectiveness separately in income. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2019. In November 2017, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2017-14, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2017-14 includes amendments to certain SEC paragraphs within the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification). ASU 2017-14 amends the Codification to incorporate the following previously issued guidance from the SEC. ‘The amendments in ASU No. 2017-14 amends the Codification to incorporate SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 116 and SEC Interpretive Release on Vaccines for Federal Government Stockpiles (SEC Release No. 33-10403) that bring existing SEC staff guidance into conformity with the FASB’s adoption of and amendments to ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In September 2017, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2017-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Leases (Topic 840), and Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to the Staff Announcement at the July 20, 2017 EITF Meeting and Rescission of Prior SEC Staff Announcements and Observer Comments.” The amendments in ASU No. 2017-13 amends the early adoption date option for certain companies related to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2016-02. Both of the below entities may still adopt using the public company adoption guidance in the related ASUs, as amended. The effective date is the same as the effective date and transition requirements for the amendments for ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-02. Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not generated revenues and has accumulated losses of $5,342,207 since inception. The Company has suffered from continuous losses with a net loss of $160,404 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and experienced negative cash flows from operations. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through December 31, 2019 is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders. Management believes the Company is currently pursuing additional financing for its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern. 4.INVESTMENT IN AN ASSOCIATE The Company, through Million Place, has a 49% interest in Yulong Pump, a pump and boiler production company in Inner Mongolia since December 1, 2012. We use the equity method to account for investments in Yulong Pump; accordingly, our results of operations include the Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of Yulong Pump. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions. Since the investment loss exceeded the carrying amount of an investment accounted for the equity method, the investment is reduced to zero as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company will resume applying the equity method only after its share of that net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended. No further investment loss from Yulong Pump was made for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 5.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS As of December 31, 2018, advances from the Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and director, Mr. John Gong, amounted to $88,526 and $88,526, respectively. The advance is unsecured, non-interest bearing and repayable on demand. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, amounts due to related parties, amounted $1,419,692 and $1,244,968, respectively. These payables are for providing management services to the Company by companies controlled by Mr. John Gong, our Chief Executive Officer .

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had a total of 39,300,000 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding. On April 16, 2018, Mr Peijiang Chen acquired an aggregate of 25,000,000 issued and outstanding common shares of Asia Pacific Boiler Corporation. The shares were acquired in a private transaction from our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Mr. John Gong. The purchase price, which was paid with personal funds of the purchaser, was $0.01 per share or $250,000 in the aggregate. The 25,000,000 common shares constitute approximately 63.61% of our issued and outstanding voting securities as at the date of this report. There are no arrangements or understandings among Mr. Peijiang Chen, Mr. John Gong, or any of their respective associates with respect to the election of directors or other matters pertaining to the Company. 7.INCOME TAXES United States The Company is incorporated in United States, and is subject to corporate income tax rate of 21%. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) resulting in significant modifications to existing law. The Company has completed the accounting for the effects of the Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect certain effects of the Act which includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% as well as other changes. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has $ 5,342,207 of cumulative net operating losses which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2038, if unutilized. The Company has provided for a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of $1,121,863 on the expected future tax benefits from the net operating loss carryforwards as the management believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized in the future. Net deferred tax assets consist of the following: WUNONG ASIA PACIFIC COMPANY LIMITED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 (Currency expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”), except for number of shares) 8.NET LOSS PER SHARE Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding is included in diluted net loss per share.

            " Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Hawkins, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hawkins, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of April 2, 2017 and April 3, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 2, 2017. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 2, 2017, listed in schedule II of this Form 10-K. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 2, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hawkins, Inc. and subsidiaries as of April 2, 2017, and April 3, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 2, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a while, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, Hawkins, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 2, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ KPMG LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota June 1, 2017 HAWKINS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 - Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Business - We have three reportable segments: Industrial, Water Treatment and Health and Nutrition. The Industrial Group specializes in providing industrial chemicals, products and services to industries such as agriculture, chemical processing, electronics, energy, food, pharmaceutical, plating and power generation. This group also manufactures and sells certain food-grade products, including liquid phosphates, lactates and other blended products. The Water Treatment Group specializes in providing chemicals, equipment and solutions for potable water, municipal and industrial wastewater, industrial process water and non-residential swimming pool water. This group has the resources and flexibility to treat systems ranging in size from a single small well to a multi-million-gallon-per-day facility. We established the Health and Nutrition segment of our business in December 2015 through our acquisition of Stauber Performance Ingredients (“Stauber”). Our Health and Nutrition Group specializes in providing ingredient distribution, processing and formulation solutions to manufacturers of nutraceutical, functional food and beverage, personal care, dietary supplement and other nutritional food and health and wellness products. This group offers a diverse product portfolio including minerals, botanicals and herbs, vitamins and amino acids, excipients, joint products, sweeteners and enzymes. Fiscal Year - Our fiscal year is a 52 or 53-week year ending on the Sunday closest to March 31. Our fiscal years ended April 2, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”) and March 29, 2015 (“fiscal 2015”) were 52 weeks. Our fiscal year ended April 3, 2016 (“fiscal 2016”) was 53 weeks. The fiscal year ending April 1, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”) will be 52 weeks. Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hawkins, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition - We recognize revenue when there is evidence that the customer has agreed to purchase the product, the price and terms of the sale are fixed, the product has shipped and title has passed to our customer, performance has occurred, and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. Shipping and Handling - All shipping and handling amounts billed to customers are included in revenues. Costs incurred related to the shipping and the handling of products are included in cost of sales. Fair Value Measurements - The financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value for each reporting period are an interest rate swap and marketable securities. There are no fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date: Level 1: Valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2: Valuation is based on inputs such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3: Valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement. In making fair value measurements, observable market data must be used when available. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents include all liquid debt instruments (primarily cash funds and money market accounts) purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. The balances maintained at financial institutions may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. Investments - Available-for-sale securities have consisted of certificates of deposit (“CD’s”) and municipal bonds and were valued at current market value, with the resulting unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of tax, as a separate component of shareholders’ equity until realized. Any impairment loss to reduce an investment’s carrying amount to its fair market value was recognized in income when a decline in the fair market value of an individual security below its cost or carrying value is determined to be other than temporary. As of April 2, 2017 and April 3, 2016, we did not own any available-for-sale securities. Trade Receivables and Concentrations of Credit Risk - Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk, principally consist of trade receivables. We sell our principal products to a large number of customers in many different industries. There are no concentrations of credit risk with a single customer from a particular service or geographic area that would significantly impact us in the near term. To reduce credit risk, we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce our receivables to an amount we estimate is collectible from our customers. Estimates used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience, current trends, aging of accounts receivable and periodic evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. Our cash balances are held at two separate financial institutions where the cash balances may exceed federally insured limits. The institutions are two of the largest commercial banking institutions in the country and both have maintained strong credit ratings. Inventories - Inventories, consisting primarily of finished goods, are primarily valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost for approximately 70% of our inventory determined using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. Cost for the other 30% of our total inventory is determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Property, Plant and Equipment - Property is stated at cost and depreciated or amortized over the lives of the assets, using the straight-line method. Estimated lives are: 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements; 3 to 20 years for machinery and equipment; and 3 to 10 years for transportation equipment and office furniture and equipment including computer systems. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. Significant improvements that add to productive capacity or extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any related gains or losses are included in income. We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable, such as prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset group from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset group, an impairment loss would be measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset group. The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets. No long-lived assets were determined to be impaired during fiscal years 2017, 2016 or 2015. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets - Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Our annual test for impairment is as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter. As of January 2, 2017, we performed an analysis of qualitative factors for our Industrial and Water Treatment reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of either of these reporting units was less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Based on management’s analysis of qualitative factors, we determined that it was not necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test for either the Industrial or Water Treatment reporting units. Because our Health and Nutrition reporting unit was new in fiscal 2016, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test. This test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered impaired, and we must recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The fair value of our Health and HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Nutrition reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of January 2, 2017, so we did not need to record a goodwill impairment charge. Our primary identifiable intangible assets include customer lists, trade secrets, non-competition agreements, trademarks and trade names acquired in previous business acquisitions. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized whereas identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. The values assigned to the intangible assets with finite lives are being amortized on average over approximately 14 years. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant. The impairment test consists of a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Based on management’s analysis of qualitative factors, we determined that it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for fiscal 2017. Impairment assessments were also completed in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2016 and 2015, which resulted in no impairment charges for either of these fiscal years. Income Taxes - In the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, the calculation of income taxes by management is based upon the estimated effective rate applicable to operating results for the full fiscal year. This includes estimating the current tax liability as well as assessing differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes. Differences that are temporary in nature result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, while differences that are permanent in nature impact the income tax expense recorded on the income statement and impact the effective tax rate for the fiscal year. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. We record any interest and penalties related to income taxes as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. The effect of income tax positions are recognized only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Changes in recognition or measurement are made as facts and circumstances change. See note 12 for further information regarding the recording of a liability and offsetting receivable regarding an uncertain tax position taken by Stauber prior to its acquisition by us. Stock-Based Compensation - We account for stock-based compensation on a fair value basis. The estimated grant date fair value of each stock-based award is recognized in expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period). Non-vested share awards are recorded as expense over the requisite service periods based on the market value on the date of grant. Earnings Per Share - Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding including the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon the exercise of stock options and the incremental shares assumed to be issued as performance units and restricted stock. Basic and diluted EPS were calculated using the following: There were no shares or stock options excluded from the calculation of weighted average common shares for diluted EPS for fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt. During fiscal 2017, we entered into an interest rate swap which was has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the purpose of which is to eliminate the cash flow impact of interest rate changes on a portion of our variable-rate debt starting in September 2017. The hedge was measured at fair value on the contract date and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, and that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are recorded in other comprehensive income, until the consolidated statement of income is affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in the fair value are recognized in the Statement of Income. HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidances removes step two of the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation. We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs. The new guidance requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented as a direct deduction from the debt liability on the balance sheet. The guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 (our fiscal 2017), with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt this guidance in our third quarter of fiscal 2016. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 requiring entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (our fiscal 2018), with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt this guidance prospectively at the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Note 2 - Business Combinations Acquisition of Stauber Performance Ingredients: On December 23, 2015, we acquired Stauber for $157.0 million on a cash-free, debt-free basis subject to a customary working capital adjustment. The total consideration for the acquisition was $158.2 million ($156.7 million net of cash acquired). We paid $156.0 million in cash at closing and paid an additional $2.2 million in early fiscal 2017 based upon closing cash, debt and working capital balances. The purchase was funded with $131.0 million of proceeds from the credit facility described more fully in Note 7 as well as cash on hand. Stauber operates out of facilities in New York and California and blends and distributes specialty products and ingredients to manufacturers of nutraceutical, functional food and beverage, personal care, dietary supplement, and other nutritional food, health and wellness products. The acquisition expands our portfolio of value-added specialty products within new markets. Stauber had revenues of approximately $118.0 million for the twelve months ended December 23, 2015, the date of the acquisition. The results of operations since the acquisition date, and the assets, including the goodwill associated with the acquisition, are included in our newly formed Health and Nutrition operating segment. Direct acquisition costs of $3.3 million, consisting mainly of professional and consulting fees, were expensed as incurred during fiscal 2016, and are classified as selling, general, and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income, and are reported in our Health and Nutrition segment. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the cost to acquire Stauber was allocated to the underlying net assets in proportion to estimates of their respective fair values. The fair value of acquired property, plant and equipment of $11.0 million was valued using a cost approach with consideration given to the continuation of the property in the current operation at the present locations. The fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets is $71.5 million. The acquired intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, have a weighted average useful life of 16.3 years and are being amortized on a straight-line basis. The intangible assets include customer relationships of $66.0 million (17 years life), trade name of $4.0 million (10 years life), non-competition agreements of $1.3 million (3.3 years weighted average life) and order backlog of $0.1 million. The fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets was determined using the income approach. In performing these valuations, the key underlying probability-adjusted assumptions of the discounted cash flows were projected revenues, gross margin expectations and operating cost estimates. The valuations were based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date and the expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. There are inherent uncertainties and management judgment required in these determinations. The fair value measurements of the assets acquired were based on valuations involving significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. None of the intangible assets are HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. As a result, a $28.6 million deferred tax liability was recorded on the opening balance sheet for the amount of non-deductible amortization expense. The purchase price of Stauber exceeded the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by $84.1 million. Cash flows used to determine the purchase price included strategic and synergistic benefits (investment value) specific to Hawkins, which resulted in a purchase price in excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets. The purchase price also included the fair values of other assets that were not identifiable, not separately recognizable under accounting rules (e.g., assembled workforce) or of immaterial value in addition to a going-concern element that represents our ability to earn a higher rate of return on the group of assets than would be expected on the separate assets as determined during the valuation process. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The final valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The following table summarizes the fair value measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date: (a) In addition to these balances, $7.3 million of cash and current accrued liabilities were recorded that relate to stock and other acquisition-related compensation payments, which were recorded by Stauber as of the acquisition date but were paid subsequent to the acquisition date. Note: Included in our consolidated balance sheet as of 4/3/2016 is an income tax receivable of $4.6 million related to pre-acquisition income taxes, with an offsetting liability payable to the prior owners as these amounts will be paid to them upon receipt. The following pro forma information has been prepared as if the Stauber acquisition and the borrowing to finance the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of the fiscal years presented. The unaudited pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of what our consolidated results of operations actually would have been had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of each fiscal year, nor is it indicative of our future operational results. HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) The unaudited pro forma financial information above is adjusted to reflect the following: (a) interest expense, including amortization of debt issuance costs, related to the $131.0 million of debt used to fund the acquisition; (b) amortization expense related to the $71.5 million of identifiable intangible assets recognized in conjunction with the acquisition; (c) elimination of amortization of intangibles and interest expense previously reflected on Stauber’s financial statements; (d) elimination of stock and other acquisition-related compensation recorded by Stauber, and transaction-related expenses recorded by us; and (e) recording income taxes at an estimated combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately 38% on these pre-tax adjustments. Acquisition of Davis Supply, Inc.: On September 18, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Davis Supply, Inc. (“Davis”) under the terms of an asset purchase agreement with Davis and its shareholders. We paid $4.5 million cash at closing, using available cash on hand to fund the acquisition. Davis was a water treatment chemical distribution company operating in Florida with revenues of approximately $5.0 million in calendar year 2014. We have integrated this business into our existing Florida locations. The results of operations after the date of acquisition and the acquired assets are included in our Water Treatment Segment. Acquisition of The Dumont Company, Inc.: On October 20, 2014, we acquired substantially all of the assets of The Dumont Company, Inc. (“Dumont”) under the terms of an asset purchase agreement with Dumont and its shareholders. We paid $10.1 million in cash including a working capital adjustment, using available cash on hand to fund the acquisition. Dumont was a water treatment chemical distribution company with revenues of approximately $14.0 million in calendar year 2013. Through this acquisition we added seven operating locations across Florida. The results of operations since the acquisition date, and the assets, including the goodwill associated with this acquisition, are included in our Water Treatment segment. Note 3 - Derivative Instruments On September 20, 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage the risk associated with a portion of our variable-rate debt. We do not utilize derivative instruments for speculative purposes. The interest rate swap involves the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated. The new swap agreement will begin September 1, 2017, and will terminate concurrently with the expiration of our credit facility on December 23, 2020. The notional amount of the swap agreement is $40 million from September 1, 2017 through August 31, 2018, $30 million from September 1, 2018 through August 31, 2019 and $20 million from September 1, 2019 through December 23, 2020. We have designated this swap as a cash flow hedge and have determined that it qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. For so long as the hedge is effective, changes in fair value of the cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive loss (net of tax) until income or loss from the cash flows of the hedged item is realized. As of and for the year ended April 2, 2017, we recorded $0.3 million in other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains (net of tax) on the cash flow hedge. An asset of $0.5 million is included in other long-term assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of April 2, 2017. No amounts were reflected in other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges for the fiscal years ended April 3, 2016 or March 29, 2015, or on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of April 3, 2016, as we did not hold any derivative instruments at that time. By their nature, derivative instruments are subject to market risk. Derivative instruments are also subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the derivative contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparty with a contract in a gain position to us fail to perform under the terms of the contract. We do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty. HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Note 4 - Fair Value Measurements Our financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Because of the variable-rate nature of our debt under our credit facility, our debt also approximates fair value. We classify the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for the asset or liability. Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are supported by little or no market activity. These fair values are determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s estimates or market participant assumptions. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by the respective counterparties based on interest rate changes. Interest rate swaps are valued based on observable interest rate yield curves for similar instruments. The following table summarizes the balances of assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of April 2, 2017. There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of April 3, 2016. Note 5 - Inventories Inventories at April 2, 2017 and April 3, 2016 consisted of the following: The FIFO value of inventories accounted for under the LIFO method was $37.0 million at April 2, 2017 and $36.5 million at April 3, 2016. The remainder of the inventory was valued and accounted for under the FIFO method. We decreased the LIFO reserve by $2.7 million in fiscal 2017 and by $1.4 million in fiscal 2016 due to an overall reduction in inventory costs per unit and lower volumes of certain inventory on hand in each of these years. HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Note 6 - Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for each of our three reportable segments were as follows: As of April 2, 2017, goodwill amounted to $97.6 million, a decrease of $0.2 million from the balance at April 3, 2016. The following is a summary of our identifiable intangible assets as of April 2, 2017 and April 3, 2016: Intangible asset amortization expense was $6.1 million during fiscal 2017, $2.4 million during fiscal 2016, and $0.9 million during fiscal 2015. The estimated future amortization expense for identifiable intangible assets during the next five years is as follows: HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Note 7 - Debt In December 2015, in connection with the Stauber acquisition described more fully in Note 2, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”), as Lead Arranger, and Sole Bookrunner, and other lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”), whereby U.S. Bank is also serving as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement included senior secured credit facilities (the “Credit Facility”) totaling $165.0 million, consisting of a $100.0 million senior secured term loan credit facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) and a $65.0 million senior secured revolving loan credit facility (the “Revolving Loan Facility”). The Revolving Loan Facility includes a letter of credit subfacility in the amount of $5.0 million and a swingline subfacility in the amount of $8.0 million. The Term Loan facility requires mandatory quarterly repayments as outlined in the table below with the remainder of the loan due at maturity. The Credit Facility is scheduled to terminate on December 23, 2020. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our personal property assets and those of our subsidiaries. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to one of the following, plus, in both cases, an applicable margin based upon our leverage ratio: (a) LIBOR for an interest period of one, two, three or six months as selected by us, reset at the end of the selected interest period, or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) U. S. Bank’s prime rate, (2) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5%, or (3) one-month LIBOR for U.S. dollars plus 1.0%. The LIBOR margin is 1.125%, 1.25% or 1.5%, depending on our leverage ratio. The base rate margin is 0.125%, 0.25% or 0.5%, depending on our leverage ratio. At April 2, 2017, the effective interest rate on our borrowings was approximately 2.2%. We used $131.0 million of the proceeds from the Credit Facility to fund our acquisition of Stauber. We may use the remaining $34.0 million for working capital, capital expenditures, restricted payments and acquisitions permitted under the Credit Facility, and other general corporate purposes. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Credit Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee on the unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee is 0.25% to 0.3%, depending on our leverage ratio. Debt issuance costs of $0.7 million paid to the lenders are reflected as a reduction of debt and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the credit facility. Amortization of debt issuance costs was $0.1 million for fiscal 2017 and immaterial for fiscal 2016. As of April 2, 2017, $0.5 million of debt issuance costs were reflected as a reduction of debt on our balance sheet. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain (a) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.15 to 1.00 and (b) a maximum total cash flow leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of significant assets, make certain investments, including any acquisitions other than permitted acquisitions, make certain payments, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, grant liens on our assets or enter into rate management transactions, subject to certain limitations. We are permitted to make distributions, pay dividends and repurchase shares so long as no default or event of default exists or would exist as a result thereof. As of April 2, 2017, we were in compliance with all required covenants. Debt at April 2, 2017 and April 3, 2016 consisted of the following: HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Scheduled annual maturities of debt as of April 2, 2017 are as follows: Note 8 - Share-Based Compensation Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units. Our Board of Directors has approved a performance-based equity compensation arrangement for our executive officers. This performance-based arrangement provides for the grant of performance-based restricted stock units that represent a possible future issuance of restricted shares of our common stock based on our pre-tax income target for the applicable fiscal year. The actual number of restricted shares to be issued to each executive officer will be determined when our final financial information becomes available after the applicable fiscal year and will be between zero shares and 54,028 shares in the aggregate for fiscal 2017. The restricted shares issued will fully vest two years after the last day of the fiscal year on which the performance is based. We are recording the compensation expense for the outstanding performance share units and then-converted restricted stock over the life of the awards. The following table represents the restricted stock activity for fiscal 2017: The weighted average grant date fair value of performance-based restricted shares issued in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $43.10, $40.89, and $34.45, respectively. We recorded compensation expense on performance-based restricted stock of approximately $1.4 million for fiscal 2017, $1.2 million for fiscal 2016 and $1.1 million for fiscal 2015, substantially all of which was recorded in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total fair value of performance-based restricted stock units vested in fiscal 2017 was $1.5 million compared to $2.0 million in fiscal 2016 and $0.8 million in fiscal 2015. Until the performance-based restricted stock units result in the issuance of restricted stock, the amount of expense recorded each period is dependent upon our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued and our then current common stock price. Upon issuance of restricted stock, we record compensation expense over the remaining vesting period using the award date closing price. Unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock and non-vested restricted share units as of April 2, 2017 was $1.3 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. The benefits of tax deductions that vary from the recognized compensation costs from share-based compensation are recorded as a change in additional paid-in capital rather than a deduction of taxes paid. The amount of excess tax benefit recognized and recorded in additional paid-in capital resulting from share-based compensation cost was $0.1 million in fiscal 2017, nominal in fiscal 2016 and $0.1 million in 2015. Restricted Stock Awards. As part of their retainer, our non-employee directors receive restricted stock for their Board services. The restricted stock awards are expensed over the requisite vesting period, which begins on the date of issuance and ends on the date of the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders, based on the market value on the date of grant. The following table represents the Board’s restricted stock activity for fiscal 2017: HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Annual expense related to the value of restricted stock was $0.3 million in fiscal 2017, $0.2 million for both 2016 and 2015, all of which was recorded in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock awards as of April 2, 2017 was $0.1 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.3 years. Stock Option Awards. Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) previously approved a long-term incentive equity compensation arrangement for our executive officers that provided for the grant of non-qualified stock options that vested at the end of a three-year period, although no stock options have been granted under this arrangement since the fiscal year ended March 28, 2010. As of April 2, 2017 and April 3, 2016 we had no stock options outstanding. During fiscal 2015, 9,333 options were exercised with an exercise price of $19.90. No expense was recorded in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015 related to the value of stock options. Note 9 - Share Repurchase Program In May 2014, our Board authorized a share repurchase program of up to 300,000 shares of our outstanding common shares. Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase shares for cash on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to applicable securities laws and regulations. Upon repurchase of the shares, we reduce our common stock for the par value of the shares with the excess applied against additional paid-in capital. No shares were repurchased during fiscal 2017. We repurchased 127,852 of common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $4.8 million during fiscal 2016, and 59,602 shares of common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $2.2 million during fiscal 2015. As of April 2, 2017, the number of shares available to be purchased under the share repurchase program was 112,546. Note 10 - Profit Sharing, Employee Stock Ownership, Employee Stock Purchase and Pension Plans Company Sponsored Plans. The majority of our non-bargaining unit employees are eligible to participate in a company-sponsored profit sharing plan. Contributions are made at our discretion subject to a maximum amount allowed under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). The profit sharing plan contribution level for each employee depends upon date of hire, with those employees hired after April 1, 2012 eligible to receive a contribution that is 50% of the contribution made for employees hired on or before April 1, 2012. Our contribution to the profit sharing plan for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 was 5% of each employee’s eligible compensation for employees hired on or before April 1, 2012. In addition to the discretionary employer contribution described above, the profit sharing plan includes a 401(k) plan that allows employees to contribute pre-tax earnings up to the maximum amount allowed under the IRC, with an employer match of up to 5% of the employee’s eligible compensation. We have an employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) covering the majority of our non-bargaining unit employees. Contributions are made at our discretion subject to a maximum amount allowed under the IRC. The ESOP contribution level for each employee depends upon date of hire, with those employees hired after April 1, 2012 eligible to receive a contribution that is 50% of the contribution made for employees hired on or before April 1, 2012. Our contribution to the ESOP for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 was 5% of each employee’s eligible compensation for employees hired on or before April 1, 2012. During fiscal 2017, we established a nonqualified deferred compensation plan covering employees who are classified as “highly compensated employees” as determined by IRS guidelines for the plan year and who were hired on or before April 1, 2012. Employees who are eligible for the nonqualified deferred compensation plan for any plan year are not eligible for the profit sharing plan contribution or the ESOP contributions described above for that plan year. Our contribution to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan for fiscal 2017 was 10% of each employee’s eligible compensation, subject to the maximum amount allowed under the IRC. HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) As described in Note 2, we acquired Stauber on December 23, 2015. Concurrent with the acquisition, Stauber’s existing company sponsored plans were terminated. Effective January 1, 2016, Stauber employees became eligible for the 401(k) component of the profit sharing plan described above, including the employer match component. We have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) covering substantially all of our employees. The ESPP allows employees to purchase newly-issued shares of the Company’s common stock at a discount from market. The number of new shares issued under the ESPP was 38,986 in fiscal 2017, 33,550 in fiscal 2016 and 31,383 in fiscal 2015. In March 2013, concurrent with our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan described below, we established a retirement plan and ESOP for our collective bargaining unit employees. Each of these plans is subject to a maximum amount allowed under the IRC. The retirement plan provides for a contribution of 5% of each employee’s eligible wages annually for employees who were eligible to enter the plan on March 1, 2013, and a contribution of 2.5% of each employee’s eligible wages annually for employees who entered the plan after March 1, 2013. Additionally, the retirement plan includes a 401(k) plan that will allow employees to contribute pre-tax earnings up to the maximum amount allowed under the IRC, with an employer match of up to 5% of the employee’s eligible compensation. The ESOP provides for contributions of 5% of each employee’s eligible wages annually for employees who were eligible to enter the plan on March 1, 2013, and a contribution of 2.5% of each employee’s eligible wages annually for employees who enter the plan after March 1, 2013. The following represents the contribution expense for the company sponsored profit sharing, ESOP, ESPP and 401(k) plans for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015: Multiemployer Pension Plan. In fiscal 2013, we concluded negotiations with two collective bargaining units to discontinue our participation in the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (“CSS” or “the plan”), a collectively bargained multiemployer pension plan. Payment of our share of the unfunded vested benefit liability is being made over 20 years and is subject to a cap. At the end of the 20-year period we will have no further liability, even if our share of the unfunded vested benefit liability has not yet been paid in full. The cash payments to be made total approximately $9.3 million, or $467,000 per year. Our payments began in fiscal 2014. Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies Leases. We have various operating leases for buildings and land on which some of our operations are located as well as trucks utilized for deliveries in certain branches. Future minimum lease payments due under operating leases with an initial term of one year or more at April 2, 2017 are as follows: Total rental expense for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows: HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Litigation. As of April 2, 2017 there were no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party or of which any of our property is the subject. Legal fees associated with such matters are expensed as incurred. Asset Retirement Obligations. We have three leases of land which contain terms that state that at the end of the lease term, we have a specified amount of time to remove the property and buildings. These leases expire in 2023, 2028 and 2034. At that time, anything that remains on the land becomes the property of the lessor, and the lessor has the option to either maintain the property or remove the property at our expense. We have not been able to reasonably estimate the fair value of the asset retirement obligations, primarily due to the combination of the following factors: The leases do not expire in the near future; we have a history of extending the leases with the lessors and currently intend to do so at expiration of the lease periods; the lessors do not have a history of terminating leases with their tenants; and because it is more likely than not that the buildings will have value at the end of the lease life and therefore, may not be removed by either the lessee or the lessor. Therefore, in accordance with accounting guidance related to asset retirement and environmental obligations, we have not recorded an asset retirement obligation as of April 2, 2017. We will continue to monitor the factors surrounding the requirement to record an asset retirement obligation and will recognize the fair value of a liability in the period in which it is incurred and a reasonable estimate can be made. Note 12 - Income Taxes The provisions for income taxes for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Reconciliations of the provisions for income taxes, based on income from continuing operations, to the applicable federal statutory income tax rate of 35% are listed below. HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) The tax effects of items comprising our net deferred tax liability as of April 2, 2017 and April 3, 2016 are as follows: As of April 2, 2017, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets at April 2, 2017 will be realized either through future taxable income or reversals of taxable temporary differences. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a gross unrecognized tax benefit of $1.9 million in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of uncertain income tax positions taken by Stauber on its tax returns for periods prior to our acquisition. We had no unrecognized tax benefits prior to the Stauber acquisition. The Stauber acquisition agreement provides the Company with indemnification from the prior owners for any tax liabilities relating to pre-acquisition tax returns. Accordingly, we also recorded an offsetting, long-term receivable for $1.9 million as of April 3, 2016, and as such any change in the unrecognized tax benefit will not impact our effective tax rate in future periods. During fiscal 2017, the unrecognized tax benefit and the offsetting receivable were reduced to $0.8 million due to the expiration of the statue of limitations for certain of the taxable periods. As of April 2, 2017 and April 3, 2016, the liability for uncertain tax positions and the corresponding receivable included $0.1 million and $0.3 million of interest and penalties, respectively. We expect these uncertain income tax amounts to decrease as the applicable examination periods by the relevant taxing authorities expire. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions. The tax years prior to our fiscal year ended April 3, 2016 are closed to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Our federal tax return filed for our fiscal year ended March 29, 2015 was examined by the Internal Revenue Service with no adjustments. For state and local income tax jurisdictions, the tax years prior to our fiscal year ended March 30, 2014 are closed to examination, with few exceptions. Note 13 - Segment Information We have three reportable segments: Industrial, Water Treatment and Health and Nutrition. Our Health and Nutrition segment was established as a result of our acquisition of Stauber near the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Product costs and expenses for each segment are based on actual costs incurred along with cost allocations of shared and centralized functions. We evaluate performance based on profit or loss from operations before income taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses. Reportable segments are defined primarily by product and type of customer. Segments are responsible for the sales, marketing and development of their products and services. Other than our Health and Nutrition segment, the segments do not have separate accounting, administration, customer service or purchasing functions. We allocate certain corporate expenses to our operating segments, and we began allocating a portion of these costs to the Health and Nutrition segment in fiscal 2017. Corporate costs allocated to Health and Nutrition were $1.9 million for fiscal 2017; these costs would have been allocated to Industrial (approximately $1.2 million) and Water Treatment (approximately $0.7 million) in past years. There are no intersegment sales and no operating segments have been aggregated. Given the nature of our business, it is not practical to disclose revenues from external customers for each product or each group of similar products. No single customer’s revenues HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) amounted to 10% or more of our total revenue. Sales are primarily within the United States and all assets are located within the United States. * Unallocated assets, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments and prepaid expenses, were $13.1 million at April 2, 2017, $32.8 million at April 3, 2016 and $53.7 million at March 29, 2015. In fiscal 2016, operating profit for the Health and Nutrition segment was negatively impacted by $3.3 million (pre-tax) of non-recurring SG&A expenses directly related to the acquisition by Hawkins. HAWKINS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Note 14 - Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) (1) The sum of quarterly per share data may not equal the full year due to rounding. Operating income in fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by non-recurring SG&A expenses directly related to the acquisition of Stauber by Hawkins of $2.7 million (pre-tax) in the third quarter and $0.6 million (pre-tax) in the fourth quarter.\n",

            " FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - 16 - Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Repro Med Systems, Inc. Chester, New York We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Repro Med Systems, Inc. as of February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Repro Med Systems, Inc. as of February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. /s/ McGrail, Merkel, Quinn & Associates, P.C.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS The accompanying notes are an integral part of these Financial Statements. - 21 - REPRO MED SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FEBRUARY 29, 2016 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2015 NOTE 1 NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES NATURE OF OPERATIONS REPRO MED SYSTEMS, INC. (the “Company”) designs, manufactures and markets proprietary medical devices primarily for the ambulatory infusion market and emergency medical applications. The Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) regulates these products. The Company operates as one segment. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company holds cash in excess of $250,000 at multiple depositories, which exceeds the FDIC insurance limits and is, therefore, uninsured. CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT The certificates of deposit are recorded at cost plus accrued interest. The certificates of deposit earn interest at a rate of 0.35% to 0.55% and mature in June 2016 and February 2017. INVENTORY Inventories of raw materials are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market value including allocable overhead. Work-in-process and finished goods are stated at the lower of standard cost or market value and include direct labor and allocable overhead. PATENTS Costs incurred in obtaining patents have been capitalized and are being amortized over the legal life of the patents. INCOME TAXES Deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. The Company believes that it has no uncertain tax positions requiring disclosure or adjustment. Generally, tax years starting with 2012 are subject to examination by income tax authorities. PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT, AND DEPRECIATION Property and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company maintains various long-term incentive stock benefit plans under which it grants stock options and restricted stock awards to certain directors and key employees. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. All options are charged against income at their fair value. The entire compensation expense of the award is recognized over the vesting period. Shares of stock granted are recorded at the fair value of the shares at the grant date, over the vesting period. - 22 - NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE Basic earnings per share are computed on the weighted average of common shares outstanding during each year. Diluted earnings per share include only an increase in the weighted average shares by the common shares issuable upon exercise of employee and director stock options (Note 6). USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Important estimates include but are not limited to, asset lives, valuation allowances, inventory, and accruals. REVENUE RECOGNITION Sales of manufactured products are recorded when shipment occurs. The Company’s revenue stream is derived from the sale of an assembled product. Other service revenues are recorded as the service is performed. Shipping and handling costs generally are billed to customers and are included in sales. The Company generally does not accept return of goods shipped unless it is a Company error. The only credits provided to customers are for defective merchandise. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-09 - Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The ASU was issued as part of the FASB’s simplification initiative and under the ASU, the areas of simplification in the update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classifications of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. The amendment eliminates the guidance in Topic 718 that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. This should not result in a change in practice because the guidance that is being superseded was never effective. The amendment in this ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. - 23 - In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The main difference between the current requirement under GAAP and this ASU is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. This ASU requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current operating leases) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current capital leases). Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. This is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. This ASU must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU and expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations upon adoption. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Prior this ASU, GAAP required an entity to separate deferred income tax asset and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts on the balance sheet. This ASU requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. This ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to all periods presented. The requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets be offset and presented as a single amount was not affected by this amendment. The Company has adopted this ASU retrospectively. In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-11-Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. The ASU was issued as part of the FASB’s simplification initiative and under the ASU, inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which would eliminate the other two options that currently exist for the market: (1) replacement cost and (2) net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted and should be applied prospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have any impact on its financial statements. In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09-Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The ASU clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) that removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements, provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets, provides more useful information to users of the financial statements through improved disclosure requirements and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. The amendments in this update are effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Full or modified retrospective adoption is required and early application is not permitted. On July 9, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606); Deferral of the Effective Date, which (a) delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), by one year to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and (b) allows early adoption of the ASU by all entities as of the original effective date for public entities. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606); Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and the effective date is the same as the requirements in ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606); Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which is intended to clarify identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas and the effective date is the same as the requirements in ASU 2014-09. The Company is assessing the impact of the adoption of the ASU on its financial statements, disclosure requirements and methods of adoption. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, trade receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. - 24 - ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever the circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. As of February 29, 2016, the Company does not believe that any of its assets are impaired. NOTE 2 INVENTORY Inventory consists of: NOTE 3 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment consists of the following at: Depreciation expense was $258,738 and $268,759 for the years ended February 29, 2016, and February 28, 2015, respectively. NOTE 4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS On December 20, 2013, we executed an agreement effective March 1, 2014, with a Company director, Dr. Mark Baker, to provide clinical research and support services related to new and enhanced applications for the FREEDOM60® Syringe Infusion System. Authorized by the Board of Directors, the agreement provides for payment of 420,000 shares of common stock valued at $0.20 per share over a three-year period. Amortization amounted to $28,000 for the each of the fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015. In August, 2014, Dr. Baker was paid a previously approved bonus of $25,000 to assist him in covering taxes due on the grant of common stock. On October 21, 2015, Cyril Narishkin was appointed to the Board of Directors and Interim Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Also effective October 21, 2015, we entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Narishkin, to support our expanded management team and accelerate our growth opportunities under his role of Interim Chief Operating Officer. The agreement provides for payment of $16,000 per month, of which half is to be paid in cash and half is to be paid in shares of common stock. Effective January 1, 2016, the agreement provides for the same payment of $16,000 per month, of which seventy-five percent is to be paid in cash and twenty-five percent is to be paid in shares of common stock. On April 26, 2016, Cyril Narishkin was appointed President of the Company. - 25 - LEASED AIRCRAFT The Company leases an aircraft from a company controlled by the Chief Executive Officer. The lease payments were $21,500 for each of the years ended February 29, 2016, and February 28, 2015. The original lease agreement has expired and the Company is currently on a month-to-month basis for rental payments. BUILDING LEASE Mr. Mark Pastreich, a director, is a principal in the entity that owns the building leased by Company. The Company is in year seventeen of a twenty-year lease. There have been no changes to lease terms since his directorship and none are expected through the life of the current lease. NOTE 5 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY On August 8, 2014, we executed an agreement with Horton Capital Partners Fund, an institutional investor based in Philadelphia, PA, to sell one million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional one million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.45 per share. The aggregate purchase price was $0.3 million. On September 30, 2015, RMS’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company will make open market purchases of up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s Outstanding Common Stock. The purchases will be made through a broker to be designated by the Company with price, timing and volume restrictions based on average daily trading volume, consistent with the safe harbor rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for such repurchases. As of February 29, 2016, the Company had repurchased 180,406 shares at an average price of $0.45 under the program. NOTE 6 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION In July 2012, 1,465,000 shares were authorized to issue to employees as share compensation valued at $0.18 per share, the market value on the date of the board authorization. The value of these shares will be amortized into operations over the one to two year restriction on the shares. Amortization amounted to zero and $51,750 for the years ended February 28, 2016, and February 28, 2015, respectively. On September 30, 2015, the Board of Directors approved the 2015 Stock Option Plan authorizing the Company to grant awards to certain employees under the plan at fair market value, subject to shareholder approval at the Annual Meeting to be held on July 27, 2016. The total number of shares of common stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share (“Common Stock”), with respect to which awards may be granted pursuant to the Plan shall not exceed 2,000,000 shares. As of February 29, 2016, the Company awarded 1,060,000 options to certain executives and key employees under the plan. On October 21, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved director compensation of $25,000 each annually, to be paid quarterly half in cash and half in common stock, effective September 1, 2015. Directors include Dr. Mark Baker, Mr. Mark Pastreich, Mr. Arthur Radin and Mr. Cyril Narishkin. For purposes of director compensation, Mr. Narishkin will receive $25,000 annually in addition to his payments under his consulting agreement. As of February 29, 2016, each director was paid $12,500 of which half was paid in cash and half in common stock of which each director received 14,566 in common shares. Beginning March 1, 2016, all Directors, excluding Mr. Andrew Sealfon, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, will receive director compensation. The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 was $0.19 and zero, respectively. The fair value of each award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016. Historical information was the primary basis for the selection of the expected volatility, expected dividend yield and the expected lives of the options. The risk-free interest rate was selected based upon yields of the U.S. Treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option being valued: - 26 - The following table summarizes the status of the Company’s stock option plan: Total stock-based compensation expense for stock option awards totaled $50,413 and zero for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 was $201,890 and zero, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, was zero for both periods. The following table presents information pertaining to options outstanding at February 29, 2016: As of February 29, 2016, there was $0.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 17 months. The total fair value of shares vested during the fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, was zero for both periods. NOTE 7 CONTINGENT LIABILITY On March 25, 2016, the Company’s legal counsel, who had represented the Company in its patent litigation withdrew as legal counsel, after discussions regarding whether they were the most suited to be our representative in this action and verbally waived payment on any remaining open invoices which totaled $0.5 million. The Company does not believe it is liable for these fees nor does it believe that the law firm will take action to collect these fees. The unpaid legal fees have been reversed. - 27 - NOTE 8 SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTION - OPERATING LEASE On February 25, 1999, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement whereby the Company sold its land and building at 24 Carpenter Road in Chester, New York and leased it back for a period of twenty years. The leaseback is accounted for as an operating lease. The gain of $0.5 million realized in this transaction has been deferred and is amortized to income in proportion to rental expense over the term of the related lease. At February 29, 2016, minimum future rental payments are: Rent expense for both the years ended February 29, 2016, and February 28, 2015 were $132,504. NOTE 9 FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes consisted of at February 29, 2016, and February 28, 2015: The reconciliation of income taxes shown in the financial statements and amounts computed by applying the Federal expected tax rate of 34% is as follows: The components of deferred tax liabilities at February 29, 2016, and February 28, 2015, respectively, are as follows: - 28 - NOTE 10 MAJOR CUSTOMERS For the years ended February 29, 2016, and February 28, 2015, approximately, 55.3% and 52.9%, respectively, of the Company’s gross product revenues were derived from one major customer. At February 29, 2016, and February 28, 2015, accounts receivable due from this customer were $0.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The largest customer in both years is a domestic medical products and supplies distributor. Although a number of larger infusion customers have elected to consolidate their purchases through one or more distributors in recent years, we continue to maintain a strong direct relationship with them. We do not believe that their continued purchases of FREEDOM60 pumps, tubing, needle sets and related supplies is contingent upon the distributor. NOTE 11 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In 2013, the Company commenced in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California a declaratory judgment action against competitor, EMED Technologies Corp. (“EMED”) to establish the invalidity of one of EMED’s patents and non-infringement of the Company’s needle sets. EMED answered the complaint and asserted patent infringement and unfair business practice counterclaims. The Company responded by asserting its own unfair business practice claims against EMED. On June 16, 2015, the Court issued what it termed a “narrow” preliminary injunction against the Company from making certain statements regarding some of EMED’s products. The Company is complying with that order. On March 24, 2016, EMED filed a motion for a second preliminary injunction regarding sales of RMS products in California. The Company is opposing that motion and briefing for this motion, as well as case discovery is ongoing. On June 25, 2015, EMED filed a claim of patent infringement for the second of its patents, also directed to the Company’s needle sets, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. This second patent is related to the one concerning the Company’s declaratory judgment action. Given the close relationship between the two patents, the Company has requested that the Texas suit be transferred to California. The Court has not yet ruled on the Company’s transfer request. Discovery in the Texas suit is ongoing. On September 11, 2015, the Company requested an ex parte reexamination of the patent in the first filed case, and on September 17, 2015 the Company requested an inter partes review (IPR) of the patent in the second filed case. On November 20, 2015, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) instituted the ex parte reexamination request having found a substantial new question of patentability concerning EMED’s patent in the first filed case. A decision to institute the IPR for EMED’s patent in the second filed case was ordered by the USPTO on February 19, 2016 having determined a reasonable likelihood all claims of the patent may be found to be unpatentable. Based on the grant of the IPR, the Company intends to request the Court stay proceedings of the second filed case until conclusion of the IPR. Although the Company believes it has meritorious claims and defenses in these litigations and proceedings, their outcomes cannot be predicted with any certainty. - 29 -\n",

            " . To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Exactus, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Exactus, Inc. (the “Company”), as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ (deficit) equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, generated negative cash flows from operating activities, has an accumulated deficit and has stated that substantial doubt exists about Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's evaluation of the events and conditions and management’s plans in regarding these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ RBSM LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014 New York, New York March 29, 2019 Exactus, Inc. (formerly known as Spiral Energy Tech, Inc.) Consolidated Balance Sheets The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. Exactus, Inc. (formerly known as Spiral Energy Tech, Inc.) Consolidated Statements of Operations The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. Exactus, Inc. (formerly known as Spiral Energy Tech, Inc.) Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Deficit The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. Exactus, Inc. (formerly known as Spiral Energy Tech, Inc.) Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. NOTE 1. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION Exactus, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on January 18, 2008, as “Solid Solar Energy, Inc.” in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company. On May 16, 2013, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to change its name to “Spiral Energy Tech., Inc.”. On February 29, 2016, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Exactus BioSolutions, Inc. (“Exactus BioSolutions”) pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement, dated February 29, 2016, with Exactus BioSolutions (the “Share Exchange”). The Company issued 30 million shares of newly-designated Series B-1 Preferred Stock to the shareholders of Exactus BioSolutions in the Share Exchange, representing approximately 87% of voting control of the Company upon consummation of the Share Exchange. As a result of the Share Exchange, Exactus BioSolutions became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exactus, Inc. Effective March 22, 2016, the Company changed its corporate name to “Exactus, Inc.” via a merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Exactus Acquisition Corp. Following the Share Exchange, the Company became a life science company that plans to develop and commercialize Point-of-Care (“POC”) diagnostics for measuring proteolytic enzymes in the blood based on a proprietary detection platform (the “New Business”). The Company’s primary product, the FibriLyzer, will employ a disposable test “biosensor” strip combined with a portable and easy to use hand held detection unit that provides a result in less than 30 seconds. The initial markets the Company intend to pursue for the FibriLyzer are (i) the management of hyperfibrinolytic states associated with surgery and trauma, (ii) obstetrics, (iii) acute events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, (iv) pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis and (v) chronic coronary disease management. The Company expects to follow up the FibriLyzer with similar technology, the MatriLyzer, to detect collagenase levels in the blood for the detection of the recurrence of cancer. The Company intends to file to gain regulatory approval to sell its products in the United States, Canada and Europe. Management intends to primarily focus on the development and commercialization of the FibriLyzer and related technology exclusively licensed by Exactus. In December 2018, the Company expanded its focus to pursue opportunities in Cannabidiol (“CBD”). This decision was based in part on the passing of The Hemp Farming Act of 2018. The Act was signed into law during December 2018 and removes hemp (cannabis with less than 0.3% THC) from the Schedule I controlled substances list. Following passage, CBD derived from industrial hemp became legal in the US under federal law and in all 50 states, opening the door to develop and sell hemp-based CBD products nationwide. The Company’s goal is to rapidly establish one or more principal sources of supply and to develop wholesale and retail sales channels for CBD end-products to be sold to humans and for animal health, such as nutraceuticals, supplements and pet and farm products. The Company intends to follow regulatorily compliant pathways by adopting practices established by the FDA for CBD. Prior to the Company’s acquisition of Exactus BioSolutions pursuant to the Share Exchange, its primary business focus was on developing and commercializing drone technology (the “Former Business”). On January 11, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a reverse stock split of the Company’s Common Stock at a ratio of 1-for-8 (the “Reverse Stock Split”) including shares issuable upon conversion of the Company’s outstanding convertible securities. All share and per share values of the Company’s common stock for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are retroactively restated for the effect of the Reverse Stock Split in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 4C. NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN These consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern. The going concern concept contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. No adjustment has been made to the carrying amount and classification of the Company’s assets and the carrying amount of its liabilities based on the going concern uncertainty. The Company has considered ASU 2014-15 in consideration of reporting requirements of the going concern financial statements. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no products available for sale. There can be no assurance that the Company’s technology will be approved for sale or, if approved for sale, be commercially successful. In addition, The Company operates in an environment of rapidly changing technology and is dependent upon the continued services of its current consultants and subcontractors. The Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $3.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and incurred a net loss of approximately $4.3 million for the year then ended. Management Plans Over the last several months the Company and its advisors have been evaluating numerous opportunities and relationships to increase shareholder value. The Company identified the rapidly growing hemp-based CBD market as a valuable target for a new company focus. On January 8, 2019, the Company entered into a Master Product Development and Supply Agreement with Ceed2Med LLC (“C2M”). C2M owns and operates cGMP facilities located in the State of Florida and elsewhere and has the expertise, resources, skills and experience suitable for CBD rich ingredients including isolates, distillates, water soluble, and proprietary formulations. Under the Agreement, the Company has been allotted a minimum of 50 and up to 300 kilograms per month, and up to 2,500 kilograms annually, of CBD rich ingredients for resale. The Company expects to be able to offer tinctures, edibles, capsules, topical solutions and animal health products manufactured for the Company by C2M to satisfy demand for branded and white-label products that the Company intends to offer to sell in the future. The Company expects to begin marketing during the first quarter of 2019. The Company expects to realize revenue through our efforts, if successful, to sell wholesale and retail finished products to third parties. However, as the Company is in a start-up phase, in a new business venture, in a rapidly evolving industry, many of our costs and challenges are new and unknown. In order to fund the Company’s activities, the Company will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and/or the issuance of debt. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company accepted subscriptions in a private placement offering of common stock of approximately $3.0 million. The Company will need to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financing, collaboration arrangements or other sources in order to continue. The issuance of any additional shares of common stock, preferred stock or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to the Company’s stockholders. In addition, adequate additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise capital, it would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate research and development programs and may not be able to continue as a going concern. NOTE 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of the United States (“GAAP”). The Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and Exactus Biosolutions, Inc. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates. The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with GAAP which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 include the fair value of derivative liabilities, contingent liabilities, and stock-based payments. Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of those investments approximates their fair market value due to their short maturity and liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts on deposit with financial institutions, which amounts may at times exceed federally insured limits. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no amounts on deposit that exceeded federally insured limits. Stock-Based Compensation. The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock-based compensation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation” and ASC Topic 505-50 “Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees”. For employee stock-based awards, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes method for stock options and the quoted price of its common stock for unrestricted shares; the expense is recognized over the requisite service period. For non-employee stock-based awards, the Company calculate the fair value of the award on the date of grant in the same manner as employee awards. Share-based expense related to the vesting of stock options and the grant of shares for services totaled $235,394 for the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no share-based expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Research and Development Expenses. The Company follow ASC 730-10, “Research and Development,” and expenses research and development costs when incurred. Accordingly, third-party research and development costs, including designing, prototyping and testing of product, are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or milestone results have been achieved. Indirect costs are allocated based on percentage usage related to the research and development. Research and development costs of $300,000 and $356,076 were incurred for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” the embedded conversion features in the convertible notes (Note 5) are not considered to be indexed to the Company’s stock. As a result, these are required to be accounted for as derivative financial liabilities and have been recognized as liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the derivative financial liabilities are determined using a binomial model with Monte Carlo simulation and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including the Company’s stock price, expected stock price volatility, the expected term, and the risk-free interest rate. The derivative financial liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and any changes in fair value is recognized as a component in other income (expenses) (Note 6). Fair Value Measurements. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The guidance prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value and establishes a three-tier value hierarchy that distinguishes among the following: ● Level 1-Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. ● Level 2-Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and models for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. ● Level 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. The Company has not transferred any liabilities between the classification levels. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has no assets that are re-measured at fair value, and its liabilities re-measured at fair value consist of derivative liabilities embedded in convertible notes, which are measured using Level 3 inputs. See Note 6. Related Parties. The Company follows ASC 850,” Related Party Disclosures,” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 “Income Taxes.” Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under FASB ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. Earnings per Share. The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share.” Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the following potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per shares because their impact was anti-dilutive: Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, \"Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. This standard provides guidance about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2017, with no significant impact the Company’s consolidate financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which amends Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Cash Flow Statements, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses eight specific cash flow classification issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The ASU creates a single source of revenue guidance for companies in all industries. The new standard provides guidance for all revenue arising from contracts with customers and affects all entities that enter into contracts to provide goods or services to their customers, unless the contracts are within the scope of other accounting standards. It also provides a model for the measurement and recognition of gains and losses on the sale of certain nonfinancial assets. This guidance, as amended, must be adopted using either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented or a modified retrospective approach and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method with no impact on its consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 (Topic 842). Topic 842 amends a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize leases with a term greater than one year as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. In July 2018, the FASB issued supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to Topic 842 within ASU 2018-10 “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases” and ASU 2018-11 “Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements.” The new guidance aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. A modified retrospective application is required with an option to not restate comparative periods in the period of adoption. This guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements, which will consist primarily of a balance sheet gross up of its operating leases to show equal and offsetting right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company anticipates using the practical expedients that are included in the guidance for existing operating leases which allows a waiver of lease assessment of their respective classification under the new standard. The Company will adopt the requirements of the new standard as new arrangements are executed. On June 20, 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07,1 which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments granted to nonemployees for goods and services. Under the ASU, most of the guidance on such payments to nonemployees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees. Currently, share-based payment arrangements to nonemployees are accounted for under ASC 718,3 while nonemployee share-based payments issued for goods and services are accounted for under ASC 505-50. ASC 505-50. Before the amendment, the major difference for the Company (but not limited to) was the determination of measurement date which generally is the date on which the measurement of equity classified share-based payments becomes fixed. Equity classified share-based payments for employees was fixed at the time of grant and nonemployee share based payments. Equity-classified nonemployee share-based payment awards are no longer measured at the earlier of the date which a commitment for performance by the counterparty is reached or the date at which the counterparty’s performance is complete. They are now measured at the grant date of the award which is the same as share-based payments for employees. The Company adopt the requirements of the new rule in the first quarter of 2019. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” (ASU 2017-04). The standard simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the amendments of ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity will recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, but the loss cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for the calendar year ending December 31, 2020. The amendments require a prospective approach to adoption and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2017-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. The standard requires a financial asset (including trade receivables) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Thus, the income statement will reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly-recognized financial assets as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. This standard will be effective for the calendar year ending December 31, 2020. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11, which amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Part I of ASU No. 2017-11, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, changes the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting the guidance on its consolidated financial statements. NOTE 4. NOTES PAYABLE On June 28, 2017, the Company issued to two of the Company’s executive officers a promissory note in the principal amount up to $100,000, which amount may be drawn upon by the Company as bridge financing for general working capital purposes. The promissory note accrues interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum and matures on the earlier of (i) one (1) year from the date of the promissory note, and (ii) the closing the sale of the Company’s securities in a single transaction or a series of related transactions from which at least $500,000 of gross proceeds are raised. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has drawn $51,400 and $48,000, respectively, on the promissory notes. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $3,981 and $1,967, respectively, of interest expense. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the notes had accrued interest balances of $5,928 and $1,967, respectively NOTE 5. CONVERTIBLE NOTES The Company’s convertible notes consist of the following as of December 31, 2018 and 2017: The following is a summary of the carrying amounts of convertible notes as of December 31, 2018 and 2017: During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $55,877 and $4,495, respectively, of interest expense for these convertible notes. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the notes had accrued interest balances of $60,372 and $4,495, respectively NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES The Company determined that the conversion options embedded in the Notes discussed in Note 5 require liability presentation at fair value. Each of these instruments provide the holder with the right to convert into common stock at a fixed discount market, with certain notes subject to a cap on the conversion price. These clauses cause uncertainty as to the number of shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debt and accordingly require liability presentation on the balance sheet in accordance with US GAAP. The fair value of the described embedded derivative on all debt was valued at $1,742,000 and $930,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company measured the fair value of the embedded derivatives using a binomial model and Monte Carlo simulations, and the following assumptions: The Company recorded change in fair value of the derivative liability on debt to market resulting in non-cash, non-operating loss of $433,855 and $54,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 the Company reclassed the derivative liability of $90,855 and $0, respectively, to additional paid in capital on conversion of convertible note. The following table provides a summary of derivative activity for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: NOTE 7. STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICT On January 11, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a reverse stock split of the Company’s Common Stock at a ratio of 1-for-8 including shares issuable upon conversion of the Company’s outstanding convertible securities. All share and per share values of the Company’s common stock for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are retroactively restated for the effect of the Reverse Stock Split in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 4C.

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to a payment as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. The Series A Preferred is convertible into such number of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share equal to the Stated Value of $8.00 ($1.00 pre-split), divided by $0.20 ($0.025 per share pre-split), subject to adjustment in the event of stock split, stock dividends, and recapitalization or otherwise. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreements each holder of Notes shall be issued Series A Preferred in the amount of the purchase price paid for such Notes by the buyer under the Exchange Agreement, including any penalty, interest and premium payments. Each share of Series A Preferred entitles the holder to vote on all matters voted on by holders of Common Stock as a single class. With respect to any such vote, each share of Series A Preferred entitles the holder to cast such number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock such share of Series A Preferred is convertible into at such time, but not in excess of the conversion limitations set forth in the Series A Preferred Certificate of Designation. The Series A Preferred will be entitled to dividends to the extent declared by the Company. There are no shares of Series A preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

These warrants have a grant date fair value of $0.042 post-split ($0.0052 pre-split) per warrant, determined using the Black-Scholes method based on the following assumptions: (1) risk free interest rate of 0.71%; (2) dividend yield of 0%; (3) volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of 27.2%; and (4) an expected life of the warrants of 3 years. The Company recorded a prepaid expense on these warrants of $8,667 in June 30, 2016 which was impaired during the year ended December 31, 2017 due to cash constraints to manufacture materials needed for trial. On October 15, 2018, the Company issued 435,750 post-split (3,486,000 pre-split) warrants with an exercise price of $0.32 post-split ($0.04 pre-split) per share and exercisable for two years to a Series B-2 Holder. These warrants have a grant date fair value of $0.32 post-split ($0.0398 pre-split) per warrant, determined using the Black-Scholes method based on the following assumptions: (1) risk free interest rate of 2.54%; (2) dividend yield of 0%; (3) volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of 396.30%; and (4) an expected life of the warrants of 2 years. The Company recorded an expense on these warrants of $138,679. There were 644,083 post-split (5,152,667 pre-split) and 208,333 post-split (1,666,667 pre-split) warrants outstanding at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively Stock Option Plan In September 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”). The 2018 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive awards in the form of non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock unit awards. The awards may be granted by the Company’s Board of Directors to its employees, directors and officers and to consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors who provide services to the Company or to a subsidiary of the Company. The exercise price for stock options must not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The incentive awards shall either be fully vested and exercisable from the date of grant or shall vest and become exercisable in such installments as the Board or Compensation Committee may specify. Stock options expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued pursuant to the Plan is 9,500,000. Unless sooner terminated, the Plan shall terminate in 10 years. On September 4, 2018, the Company granted a total of 209,375 post-split (1,675,000 pre-split) five-year non-qualified stock options to the Company’s officers exercisable at $0.712 post-split ($0.089 pre-split) per share, of which 138,844 post-split (1,118,750 pre-split) vested immediately, 11,179 post-split (93,750 pre-split) vest monthly in equal increments over a 16-month period beginning on September 1, 2018, and 57,812 post-split (462,500 pre-split) vest monthly in equal increments over a 28-month period beginning on September 1, 2018. As part of new employment agreements with three of the Company’s officers, 18,750 post-split (150,000 pre-split) of their remaining unvested options on December 1, 2018 vested immediately. On October 22, 2018, the Company granted 250,000 post-split (2,000,000 pre-split) ten-year non-qualified stock options to a consultant exercisable at $0.32 post-split ($0.04 pre-split) per share, all of which vested immediately. On December 28, 2018, the Company granted 500,000 post-split (4,000,000 pre-split) ten-year non-qualified stock options to a consultant exercisable at $0.32 post-split) ($0.04 pre-split) per share, all of which vested immediately. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense related to stock options granted is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for the options granted during the year ended December 31, 2018 are presented below: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The expected term assumption for stock options granted is the contractual term of the option award. The Company has never declared or paid dividends on its common stock and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are recognized as a reduction of stock-based compensation expense as they occur. The Company recognized $227,394 of compensation expense relate to the vesting of stock options for the year ended December 31, 2018. These amounts are included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying statement of operations. Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2018 is presented below and reflects the effect of the 1 for 8 Reverse Stock Split in January 2019: The aggregate intrinsic value of options at December 31, 2018 is based on the Company’s closing stock price on that date of $0.16 post-split ($0.02 pre-split) per share. As of December 31, 2018, there was $29,663 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which the Company expects to recognize over the weighted average remaining period of 2 years. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had reserved shares of its common stock for future issuance and reflects the effect of the 1 for 8 Reverse Stock Split in January 2019 as follows: NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The following table summarizes the significant differences between the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for financial statement purposes for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized as follows: As of December 31, 2018, the Company has available federal net operating loss carry forward of $10.5 million, the most significant of which expire from 2020 until 2037. The Company assess the recoverability of its net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the “more likely than not” recognition criteria. The Company continues to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support full or partial reversal. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a valuation allowance totaling $2.7 million against its deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, due to insufficient positive evidence, primarily consisting of losses within the taxing jurisdictions that have tax attributes and deferred tax assets. Since the Company has recently added to the scope of its activities efforts to produce, market and sell products made from industrial hemp containing cannabidiol (CBD).The Company and its Management has not determined as of the statement date how IRC Section 280E will affect the deduction of Company related expenditures related to such business, but Management has provided a Full Valuation Reserve to the Company’s Deferred Tax Assets. For U.S. purposes, the Company has not completed its evaluation of net operating loss carryforwards utilization limitations under Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”), Section 382/383, change of ownership rules. If the Company has had a change in ownership, the net operating loss carryforwards would be limited as to the amount that could be utilized each year and could be eliminated, based on the Code. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The law includes significant changes to the US Corporate income tax system, including a Federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%, limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation and the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system. As the Company is not currently a taxpayer due to ongoing operating losses, the impact on the financial statements is not material. We have reflected the lower rates in the calculation above in the December 31, 2018 information. NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, the Company enter into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions which, in its judgment, are normal and customary for companies in the Company’s industry sector. These agreements are typically with business partners, clinical sites, and suppliers. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company generally agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to the Company’s product candidates, use of such product candidates, or other actions taken or omitted by us. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. The Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of December 31, 2018, and 2017. Through the Share Exchange, the Company acquired an exclusive license agreement (the “Licensing Agreement”) between Exactus BioSolutions and Digital Diagnostics Inc. (“Digital Diagnostics”) that the Company recognized as an intangible asset. Pursuant to the Licensing Agreement, Digital Diagnostics granted to Exactus BioSolutions an exclusive license to develop, produce and commercialize certain diagnostic products, including the FibriLyzer and MatriLyzer, that utilize certain intellectual property rights owned or licensed by Digital Diagnostics. The Licensing Agreement provides for Exactus BioSolutions and Digital Diagnostics to collaborate through the various steps of the product and device development process, including the development, regulatory approval and commercialization stages. Exactus BioSolutions is required to pay Digital Diagnostics, in cash and/or stock, an initial signing payment, milestone fees triggered by the first regulatory clearance or approval of each of the FibriLyzer and the MatriLyzer, and various sales thresholds, and royalty payments based on the net sales of the products, calculated on a product-by-product basis. In 2016, the Company paid $50,000 to Digital Diagnostics as part of the initial signing payment under the Licensing Agreement and $21,659 in legal expenses. As of December 31, 2016, the Company accrued an additional $171,033 in licensing fees due to closing a financing transaction in the fourth quarter of 2016, of which $75,000 was paid during the first quarter of 2017. The Company accrued the remaining $30,000 due for the initial signing fee during the third quarter of 2017. The Company has also accrued interest, per the Licensing Agreement, of $9,802 for the remaining balance due as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, $134,802 remained due to Digital Diagnostics. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company paid the entire balance due to Digital Diagnostics. No milestones have been met and no milestone fees have been paid or accrued through December 31, 2018. The License Agreement is effective until such time as neither Digital Diagnostics nor Exactus Biosolutions has any obligation to the other under the Licensing Agreement in any country with respect to any product. The Licensing Agreement may be terminated by the Company effective upon at least six (6) months written notice if regulatory approval has been obtained in the U.S. or in the European Union, or upon at least three (3) months written notice if regulatory approval has not been obtained in the U.S. or in the European Union. Either party may terminate the Licensing Agreement in the event the other party materially breaches the Licensing Agreement, or becomes insolvent. On July 16, 2018, the Company received Notice from Digital Diagnostics, Inc. of the Licensor’s intent to terminate the Licensing Agreement. The Company disputes the validity of the Notice and maintains that the Agreement is in full force and effect until January 19, 2019 (the “Expiration Date”) and that the Company’s maintains the right to use the license and intellectual property granted to the Company under the Agreement until the Expiration Date. The Company has retained counsel to represent the Company with regard to the enforceability of the Agreement and related matters arising from the Notice and is in compliance with the Dispute Resolution and arbitration provisions of the Agreement. On January 23, 2019, Digital Diagnostics, Inc., made a demand for compensation against the Company in connection with an alleged breach of a License Agreement. No lawsuit has been filed; however, in the event a lawsuit is filed, the Company intends to vigorously contest the matter. On June 30, 2016, in order to conduct a clinical trial for the FibriLyzer and other studies, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”) with Integrium LLC (“Integrium”) and PoC Capital, LLC (“PoC Capital”). Under the MSA, Integrium has agreed to perform clinical research services in support of the development of POC diagnostics devices. Integrium is to conduct one or more studies in compliance with FDA regulations and pursuant to the Company’s specific service orders. PoC Capital has agreed to fund up to the first $1,000,000 in study costs and fees due to Integrium, with all fees in costs in excess of that amount being the Company’s sole responsibility, in exchange for 200,000 post-split (1,600,000 pre-split) shares of the Company’s common stock, 1,733,334 shares of newly designated Series C Preferred Stock, and 208,333 post-split (1,666,667 pre-split) warrants to purchase the Company’s common stock at a price of $4.80 post-split ($0.60 pre-split) per share exercisable for three years. For the year ended December 31, 2016 the Company had accounted $1,000,000 as prepaid expenses on the balance sheet which was impaired during the year ended December 31, 2017 due to cash constraints to manufacture materials needed for trial. On January 20, 2017, Robert F. Parker (the “petitioner”) filed a petition in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the “Court”), naming, among others, the Company and Ezra Green, a former shareholder, director and officer of the Company, as respondents. The petition was received by the Company on February 7, 2017. The parties reached an agreement on settlement which requires co-defendant Ezra Green to make an initial payment with subsequent, additional payments over time. The Company has agreed, in exchange for the dismissal of all claims with prejudice, to pay up to $20,000, at $1,000 per month beginning in January 2018 at the earliest, if co-defendant Ezra Green defaults on his subsequent payment obligations under the terms of the settlement agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company has paid $3,000 towards the settlement with a remaining balance due of $17,000. On December 14, 2018, the Company received a termination and demand notice from KD Innovation, Ltd, an entity 100% owned by a former Board member, in connection with a consulting agreement KDI entered into with the Company on or about January 20, 2016. No lawsuit has been filed; however, in the event a lawsuit is filed, the Company intends to vigorously contest the matter. NOTE 10. RELATED PARTY CONSIDERATIONS Some of the officers and directors of the Company are involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities that become available. They may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and other business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts. On November 20, 2017, Dr. Dimitrov provided a notice dated November 21, 2017 to the Company stating that he was resigning from the Board, effective immediately. Dr. Dimitrov indicated that his resignation from the Board was based on the deteriorating relationship between the Company and Digital Diagnostics over the non-payment of fees owed by the Company pursuant to the licensing agreement between the Company and Digital Diagnostics. Dr. Dimitrov currently serves as the President of Digital Diagnostics, and the Company has licensed the right to develop, produce and commercialize certain diagnostic products, including the FibriLyzer and MatriLyzer, utilizing certain intellectual property rights owned or licensed by Digital Diagnostics. Dr. Dimitrov believes that, in light of these concerns, his role as both a Director of the Company and the President of Digital Diagnostics creates a conflict of interest and has decided to focus his time and energy on doing what is best for the shareholders of Digital Diagnostics. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company accrued $30,000 in licensing fees expenses to Digital Diagnostics. As of December 31, 2017, $126,032 was included in accounts payable. The Company has also accrued interest at 3% over the prime rate, per the Licensing Agreement, of $9,802 for the remaining balance due as of December 31, 2017. The Company paid $126,032 and $75,000 during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $300,000 was recognized in Research and Development expenses for consulting provided by Dr. Dimitrov. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $575,000 and $275,000 was included in accounts payable, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $0 and $125,000, respectively was paid. Effective December 1, 2018, the Company entered into new employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, our Executive Vice President, and our Chief Financial Officer. Under these agreements, the executives agreed to terminate predecessor employment agreements and agreed to release the Company from any and all obligations under the predecessor agreement for any amounts that could have been due or owing, including, without limitation, compensation, bonuses and other payments. On February 21, 2019, the Company executed a termination agreement and mutual release with the Chief Business Officer. The agreement contains mutual releases between the parties. As a result of these agreements, the Company recognized $1,355,372 in debt forgiveness which was recorded under additional paid in capital. On June 28, 2017, the Company issued to two of the Company’s executive officers a promissory note in the principal amount up to $100,000, which amount may be drawn upon by the Company as bridge financing for general working capital purposes. The promissory note accrues interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum and matures on the earlier of (i) one (1) year from the date of the promissory note, and (ii) the closing the sale of the Company’s securities in a single transaction or a series of related transactions from which at least $500,000 of gross proceeds are raised. See Note 4. NOTE 11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In accordance with authoritative guidance, the Company has evaluated any events or transactions occurring after December 31, 2018, the balance sheet date, through the date of filing of this report and note that there have been no such events or transactions that would require recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, except as disclosed below. On January 8, 2019 we began pursuing a new business segment and entered into a Master Product Development and Supply Agreement (the “Master Agreement”) with Ceed2Med, LLC (“C2M”), a Florida limited liability company. We determined to pursue opportunities in hemp based CBD following passage of the 2018 Farm Bill which was signed into law on December 20, 2018. On January 23, 2019, Digital Diagnostics made a demand for compensation against the Company in connection with an alleged breach of a License Agreement entered into with the Company on January 19, 2016 (see Note 9). No lawsuit has been filed; however, in the event a lawsuit is filed, the Company intends to vigorously contest the matter. On March 11, 2019, we acquired a 50.1% limited liability membership interest in Exactus One World, LLC (“EOW”), an Oregon limited liability company, in order to produce industrial hemp for our own use. EOW leases approximately 200 acres of farm land in Cave Junction, Oregon for growing and processing industrial hemp. EOW will farm and process industrial hemp to be manufactured into cannabidiol (CBD) and related products. EOW is a newly-formed limited liability company that will be responsible for the Company’s initial efforts to pursue agricultural development, including farm soil preparation, planting, harvesting, transportation and drying. In March 2019 we placed an order for seeds (genetics) for the 2019 grow season. The Company will be responsible for funding and the minority owners will be responsible for management, servicing and operating the farm properties. The EOW introduction and negotiation of the definitive agreements were provided by C2M who will also be responsible for overseeing all farming activities and manufacturing. We are currently negotiating the terms for provision of services by C2M to the Company, including access to C2M management and personnel, skills and expertise, access to investments such as EOW and future business opportunities, and operations and oversight over our farming, manufacturing and processing operations and compensation therefore. Following the events described above, the Company entered into the business production and selling of products made from industrial hemp. Industrial hemp is defined as plants containing less than 0.03% tetra-hydrocannabinol, the lawful limit of the psychoactive compound present to be considered industrial hemp. The Company will own and develop hemp products under its own brand “Hemp Healthy” and produce products for private label customers. The Company is presently offering tinctures, edibles, capsules, topical solutions and animal health products manufactured for us by C2M during the second quarter of 2019. On March 6, 2019 we placed a $1 million order for products from C2M. On March 20, 2019 we entered into agreements to acquire Tierra Healthcare Concepts, LLC (“Tierra”), a Florida limited liability company, and CannacareMD, LLC (“Cannacare”), a Florida limited liability company. Through existing networks of physicians and websites Tierra and Cannacare intend to assist doctors to educate consumers about CBD, and to offer our own “Hemp Healthy” brand hemp products through online stores (www.buyhempcbd.com). Following December 31, 2018, in order to pursue our new business segment, the Company undertook a number of steps to recapitalize and reorganize our management structure. These actions included the following: 1. Five new members joined our board of directors. Three of the directors are considered to be independent directors. The Company established an Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee for the first time, consisting entirely of independent directors. Each committee adopted a committee charter meeting the board, committee and charter requirements for listing on NASDAQ. 2. The Company offered and sold approximately $3.0 million of Common Stock in private placements. 3. The Company converted all of our outstanding convertible notes and issued 829,450 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. 4. The Company adopted and implemented a 1:8 reverse split of our capital stock which became effective March 11, 2019. 5. James Erickson and Timothy Ryan, directors, resigned. Each of these former directors waived all outstanding financial and other obligations of the Company (other than certain rights such as the right to indemnification).\n",

            " The financial statement provided indicates that the company has incurred losses from its operations, resulting in negative cash flows from operating activities. Additionally, the company has an accumulated deficit, and there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. This means that there are concerns about the company's ability to meet its financial obligations and continue operating in the foreseeable future.\n",

            "In terms of expenses, the company has liabilities that are part of its normal course of business operations. Despite the uncertainties surrounding the company's ability to continue as a going concern, no adjustments have been made to the carrying amount and classification of the company's assets and liabilities. The company has considered ASU 2014, which likely pertains to accounting standards related to going concern issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "The liabilities mentioned in the financial statement primarily consist of debt. It is essential to note that the company's financial position seems to be precarious, given the accumulated losses, negative cash flows, and doubts about its ability to continue operating. The management's evaluation of the situation, as described in Note 2 of the financial statement, likely outlines the events and conditions that have led to this financial position and the management's plans to address these challenges.\n"
