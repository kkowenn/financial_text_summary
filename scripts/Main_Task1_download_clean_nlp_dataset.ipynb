Notes to Financial Statements For The Years Ended December 31, 2013 And 2012 Notes 1- GENERAL The Company Probe Manufacturing, Inc. was founded in 1993. Probe is a high quality global electronics manufacturing service (EMS) company. We provide a full range of engineering, manufacturing and integrated supply chain services to original equipment manufacturers (OEM) companies, who design and market electronic products. Currently, our revenue is generated from sales of our services primarily to customers in the medical device, aerospace, alternative fuel, industrial and instrumentation products manufacturers. Probe's EMS offerings include new product introduction, collaborative design, materials management, product manufacturing, product testing and product warranty repair, and end-of-life support. Because our core business is a service company, we\\u2019re impacted by our customer\\u2019s ability to appropriately predict market demand for their products. While we work with our customers to understand their demand needs, we are removed from the actual end-market served by our customers. Consequently determining future trends and estimates of activity can be very difficult. Going Concern The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a total stockholder\\u2019s equity of $728,892 and a working capital surplus of $123,717; however, we still had net loss of $(650,652) for the year ended December 31, 2013 and an accumulated deficit of $(1,286,907) as of December 31, 2013 and used $266,038 in net cash from operating activity for the year ended December 31, 2013. Therefore, the ability of the Company to operate as a going concern is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations. Plan of Operations Management is taking the following steps to sustain profitability and growth: (i) organic growth, new sales and expansion of services along the supply chain line; (ii) Utilization of our manufacturing foundry platform to support innovators by making investment in their technologies in return for manufacturing rights and equity; (iv) expansion of capabilities and competencies through mergers & acquisitions providing scale, cost synergies and revenue opportunities. Our future success is likely dependent on our ability to sustain profitable growth and attain additional capital to support our future success is likely dependent on our ability to attain growth capital in order to sustain growth and profitability. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any such financing, or that it will be able to generate sufficient positive cash flow from operations. The successful outcome of these or any future activities cannot be determined at this time and there is no assurance that if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute its business plans. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurances that this financing will be sufficient to sustain profitable growth and attain additional capital to support growth. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any such additional financing, or that we will be able to generate sufficient positive cash flow from operations. The successful outcome of these or any future activities cannot be determined at this time and there is no assurance that if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute its business plans. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Financial Statements NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: The accompanying financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013. We follow the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of the United States, or GAAP. Certain of the principles involve selection among alternatives and choices of methods, which are described in the footnotes to our audited financial statements. Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates may be materially different from actual financial results. Significant estimates include the recoverability of long-lived assets, the collection of accounts receivable and valuation of inventory and reserves. Cash and Cash Equivalents We maintain the majority of its cash accounts at a commercial bank. The total cash balance is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\\u201cFDIC\\u201d) up to $250,000 per commercial bank. For purposes of the statement of cash flows we consider all cash and highly liquid investments with initial maturities of one year or less to be cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable We grant credit to its customers located within the United States of America; and do not require collateral. Our ability to collect receivables is affected by economic fluctuations in the geographic areas and industries served by us. Reserves for un-collectable amounts are provided, based on past experience and a specific analysis of the accounts. Although we expect to collect amounts due, actual collections may differ from the estimated amounts. As of December 31, 2013, we had a reserve for potentially un-collectable accounts of $38,441. Five (5) customers accounted for approximately 80% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2013 and one customer accounted for 26% and no other customer accounted for more than 22% of the accounts receivable balance. Our trade accounts primarily represent unsecured receivables. Historically, our bad debt write-offs related to these trade accounts have been insignificant. Inventory Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market value. Our industry experiences changes in technology, changes in market value and availability of raw materials, as well as changing customer demand. We make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventories based on regular audits and cycle counts of our on-hand inventory levels and forecasted customer demands and at times additional provisions are made. Any inventory write offs are charged to the reserve account. As of December 31, 2013, we had a reserve for potentially obsolete inventory of $205,000. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Assets held under capital leases are recorded at lease inception at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the related assets. The cost of ordinary maintenance and repairs is charged to operations. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the related assets: Furniture and fixtures 3 to 7 years Equipment 7 to 10 years Leasehold improvements 2 years (life of the lease) Financial Statements Long -Lived Assets Our management assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by determining whether the depreciation and amortization of long lived assets over their remaining lives can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows. The amount of long-lived asset impairment if any, is measured based on fair value and is charged to operations in the period in which long-lived assets impairment is determined by management. There can be no assurance however, that market conditions will not change or demand for our services will continue, which could result in impairment of long-lived assets in the future. Revenue Recognition Revenue from product and services are recognized at the time goods are shipped or services are provided to the customer, with an appropriate provision for returns and allowances. Terms are generally FOB origination with the right of inspection and acceptance. We have not experienced a material amount of rejected or damaged product. The Company provides services for its customers that range from contract design to original product design to repair services. The Company recognizes service revenue when the services have been performed, and the related costs are expensed as incurred. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of accounts payable and accrued expenses are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Other Comprehensive Income We have no material components of other comprehensive income (loss) and accordingly, net loss is equal to comprehensive loss in all periods. Net Profit / (Loss) per Common Share Basic profit / (loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. At December 31, 2013, we had outstanding common shares of 24,251,945 used in the calculation of basic earnings per share. Basic Weighted average common shares and equivalents at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were 22,243,577 and 19,848,119, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding warrants to purchase 1,050,000 additional common shares and options to purchase 107,789 additional common shares. Fully diluted weighted average common shares and equivalents for the years ended 2013 and 2012 were withheld from the calculation in 2013, as they were anti-dilutive due to the net loss. Research and Development Research and Development Costs incurred in association with the alternative fuels technology development (which include salaries and equipment) were expensed as incurred. We expensed $0 in R&D during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. Segment Disclosure FASB Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting financial and descriptive information about an enterprise\\u2019s reportable segments. We have determined that we have one reportable segment, with contract electronics manufacturing. As such, our operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment for all periods presented. Financial Statements Share Based Compensation The company has adopted the use of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, \\u201cShare-Based Payment\\u201d (SFAS No. 123R) (now contained in FASB Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, \\u201cAccounting for Stock Issued to Employees\\u201d, and its related implementation guidance and eliminates the alternative to use Opinion 25\\u2019s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in Statement 123 as originally issued. This Statement requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instruments, which includes grants of stock options and stock warrants, based on the fair value of the award, measured at the grant date, (with limited exceptions). Under this standard, the fair value of each award is estimated on the grant date, using an option-pricing model that meets certain requirements. We use the Black- Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our equity awards, including stock options and warrants. The Black-Scholes model meets the requirements of SFAS No. 123R; however, the fair values generated may not reflect their actual fair values, as it does not consider certain factors, such as vesting requirements, employee attrition and transferability limitations. The Black-Scholes model valuation is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We estimate the expected volatility and estimated life of our stock options at grant date based on historical volatility; however, due to the thinly traded nature of our stock, we have chosen to use an average of the annual volatility of like companies in our industry. For the \\u201crisk-free interest rate\\u201d, we use the Constant Maturity Treasury rate on 90 day government securities. The term is equal to the time until the option expires. The dividend yield is not applicable, as the company has not paid any dividends, nor do we anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future. The fair value of our restricted stock is based on the market value of our free trading common stock, on the grant date calculated using a 20 trading day average. At the time of grant, the share based-compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest using historical employee attrition rates and the expense is reduced accordingly. It is also adjusted to account for the restricted and thinly traded nature of the shares. The expense is reviewed and adjusted in subsequent periods if actual attrition differs from those estimates. We re-evaluate the assumptions used to value our share-based awards on a quarterly basis and if changes warrant different assumptions, the share-based compensation expense could vary significantly from the amount expensed in the past. We may be required to adjust any remaining share-based compensation expense, based on any additions, cancellations or adjustments to the share based awards. The expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award-the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 we had $2,124 and $13,300, respectively, in share based expense, due to the issuance of common stock shares to employees of the company. As of December 31, 2013 we had $0 in non-vested expense to be recognized. In addition we recognized $6,927 in 2013 for the issuance of common stock warrants Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS No. 109 (now contained in FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes), which requires the asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when differences are expected to reverse. As of December 31, 2013, we had a net operating loss carry forward of $(1,005,507) and a deferred tax asset of $341,872 using the statutory rate of 34%. The deferred tax asset may be recognized in future periods, not to exceed 20 years. However, due to the uncertainty of future events we have booked valuation allowance of $339,809. Acquisition of Trident Manufacturing Financial Statements On March 15, 2013, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Acquisition with Trident Manufacturing, Inc., a Utah corporation, (\\u201cTrident\\u201d), and the shareholders of Trident, to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock shares of Trident. Trident is a full-service electronics manufacturing service company with a 16,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility based in Salt Lake City, Utah and has been servicing the industrial, aerospace, military, instrumentation, and medical markets since 2005. On March 20, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Trident whereby we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock shares of Trident and all its operational assets in exchange for 1,600,000 shares of our restricted shares of common stock.

Share repurchases will be funded with the Company's available cash, after determining the working capital requirements of the Company. Accordingly, there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased under the plan. The company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase plan because it believes recent market conditions may have caused the Company's common stock to be undervalued. The timing and number of any shares repurchased will depend on the terms and conditions of the plan and no assurance can be given that any specific amount of common stock will be repurchased. As of December 31, 2013, we had repurchased 11,500 shares of our common stock.

Any issuance by us of shares of our preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of our control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock.

Index to Consolidated Financial Statements REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors iTrackr Systems, Inc. (formerly Must Haves, Inc.) We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of iTrackr Systems, Inc. (formerly Must Haves, Inc.) (the \\u201cCompany\\u201d), as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related statements of operations, stockholders\\u2019 equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, based on our audits, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of iTrackr Systems, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related statements of operations, stockholders\\u2019 equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. However, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans in regards to these matters are described in Note A. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Bedinger & Company Certified Public Accountants Concord, California February 7, 2011 iTrackr Systems, Inc.

(Formerly Must Haves, Inc.) Notes to Financial Statements For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Note A-Organization and Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies Organization iTrackr, Inc. (the \\u201cCompany\\u201d or \\u201ciTrackr\\u201d) was formed on May 10, 2006 to develop, market and commercialize a product and inventory search application through a social networking site designed to leverage the best of Internet and Mobile technologies. iTrackr has taken several markets, including eCommerce, social networking and mobile content, and developed a platform that drives value to consumers, retailers and advertising and marketing firms. In 2009, iTrackr purchased online customer support software technology from ChatStat for approximately $95,000. iTrackr has launched its customer support chat software which facilitates real-time customer support, expert advice, and paid transactions. On January 12, 2010, the Company closed a share exchange transaction pursuant to which it (i) became the 100% parent of iTrackr, Inc., a Florida corporation (\\u201ciTrackr\\u201d), (ii) assumed the operations of iTrackr, and (iii) changed its name from Must Haves, Inc. to iTrackr Systems, Inc. iTrackr, Inc. was deemed to be the acquirer in the reverse merger. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations of iTrackr, Inc. prior to the Merger are reflected in the financial statements and have been recorded at the historical cost basis of iTrackr, Inc. Our financial statements, after completion of the Merger, include the assets and liabilities of both Must Haves, Inc. and iTrackr, Inc. We accounted for the merger under recapitalization accounting whereby the equity of the acquiring enterprise (iTrackr, Inc.) is presented as the equity of the combined enterprise and the capital stock account of the acquiring enterprise is adjusted to reflect the par value of the outstanding stock of the legal acquirer (Must Haves, Inc.) after giving effect to the number of shares issued in the business combination (1,303,638 shares). Shares retained by the legal acquirer (Must Haves, Inc. 1,303,638 shares) are reflected as an issuance as of the reverse merger date (January 12, 2010) for the historical amount of the net assets of the acquired entity which is in this case is a net liability of $27,515. During 2010 we completed the development of our Chat software and TrackiT, PriceiT and iTrackr community applications thereby leaving the Development Stage and focusing increasing attention on sales. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. In the course of funding development activities and sales initiatives, the Company has sustained operating losses and has an accumulated deficit of $4,074,259 and $3,024,954 at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. In addition, the Company has negative working capital of $958,093 and $692,182 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company has and will continue to use significant capital to commercialize its products. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. In this regard, management is proposing to raise any necessary additional funds not provided by operations through loans or through additional sales of their common stock. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising this additional capital or in achieving profitable operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. Accounting estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. iTrackr Systems, Inc. (Formerly Must Haves, Inc.) Notes to Financial Statements For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Note A-Organization and Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and cash equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents may at times exceed federally insured limits. To minimize this risk, the Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality institutions. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are reported at the customers' outstanding balances. The Company does not have a history of significant bad debt and has not recorded any allowance for doubtful accounts. Interest is not accrued on overdue accounts receivable. The Company evaluates receivables on a regular basis for potential reserve. Fixed assets Fixed assets are stated at cost. Major renewals and improvements are charged to the asset accounts while replacements, maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets, are expensed. At the time fixed assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved of the applicable amounts. Gains or losses from retirements or sales are credited or charged to income. Depreciation of fixed assets is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives used are 3 years for computer equipment, office equipment and software. Accelerated methods of depreciation of fixed assets are used for income tax purposes. Revenue recognition policy Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Deferred Revenue: Revenue is deferred for any undelivered elements and is recognized upon product delivery or when the service has been performed. Sales and marketing costs Sales and marketing expenses include advertising expenses, seminar expenses, commissions and personnel expenses for sales and marketing. Marketing and advertising costs to promote the Company's products and services are expensed in the period incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company incurred no marketing and advertising expense. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company\\u2019s financial instruments include cash and accounts receivable. The carrying amount of these financial instruments has been estimated by management to approximate fair value. \\u201cDisclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\\u201d requires disclosures of information regarding the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value. For purpose of this disclosure, the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale of liquidation. The company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: Level 1 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. We have no Level 1 instruments as of December 31, 2010. iTrackr Systems, Inc. (Formerly Must Haves, Inc.) Notes to Financial Statements For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Note A-Organization and Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued) Level 2 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. We have no Level 2 instruments as of December 31, 2010. Level 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\\u2019s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. We have no Level 3 instruments as of December 31, 2010. Research and Development Expenses related to present and future products are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets that do not meet the criteria for recognition. In the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes. The Company follows the accounting guidance which provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax provisions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized initially and in subsequent periods. Also included is guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company reports both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. Basic loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the period. Diluted loss per share includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants, using the \\u201ctreasury stock\\u201d method and convertible securities using the \\u201cif-converted\\u201d method. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost-carrying value of an asset may not be recovered. The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the fair value of the asset. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset's carrying value and fair value. The Company has never recognized an impairment charge. iTrackr Systems, Inc. (Formerly Must Haves, Inc.) Notes to Financial Statements For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Note A-Organization and Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for all compensation related to stock, options or warrants using a fair value based method whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of options and warrants issued to both employees and non-employees. In calculating this fair value, there are certain assumptions that we use consisting of the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate. The use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense. We periodically issue common stock as compensation. Pursuant to ASC 505-50-30-6 issuances are valued using the market price of the stock or value of the services rendered on the date of the related agreement, whichever is more readily determinable. To date, common stock granted and issued for services has been issued free of obligation to the recipient and for no consideration. The shares are valued at the price non-employees are willing to accept as payment in lieu of cash, which, historically, has been the price per share of recent sales of unregistered securities or value of debt converted to common stock. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On July 1, 2009, the FASB officially launched the FASB ASC 105 - Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\\u201cthe Codification\\u201d), as the single official source of authoritative, nongovernmental, U.S. GAAP, in addition to guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Codification is designed to simplify U.S. GAAP into a single, topically ordered structure. All guidance contained in the Codification carries an equal level of authority. The Codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Accordingly, the Company refers to the Codification in respect of the appropriate accounting standards throughout this document as \\u201cFASB ASC\\u201d. Implementation of the Codification did not have any impact on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements. On June 30, 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2009-01 (Topic 105) - Generally Accepted Accounting Principles - amendments based on - Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 168 -The FASB Accounting and Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Beginning with this Statement the FASB will no longer issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions, or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead, it will issue Accounting Standard Updates. This ASU includes FASB Statement No. 168 in its entirety. While ASU\\u2019s will not be considered authoritative in their own right, they will serve to update the Codification, provide the bases for conclusions and changes in the Codification, and provide background information about the guidance. The Codification modifies the GAAP hierarchy to include only two levels of GAAP: authoritative and nonauthoritative. ASU No. 2009-01 is effective for financial statements issued for the interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Company adopted this statement no significant financial impact. In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-05 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) - Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value. This ASU clarifies the fair market value measurement of liabilities. In circumstances where a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following techniques: a technique that uses quoted price of the identical or a similar liability or liabilities when traded as an asset or assets, or another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of Topic 820 such as an income or market approach. ASU No. 2009-05 was effective upon issuance and it did not result in any significant financial impact on the Company upon adoption. In September 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-12 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) - Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its equivalent). This ASU permits use of a practical expedient, with appropriate disclosures, when measuring the fair value of an alternative investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value. ASU No. 2009-12 is effective for interim and annual periods iTrackr Systems, Inc. (Formerly Must Haves, Inc.) Notes to Financial Statements For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Note A-Organization and Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Continued) ending after December 15, 2009, with early application permitted. Since the Company does not currently have any such investments, this statement had no impact on its financial statements. In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-09, \\u201cSubsequent Events (Topic 855); Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements.\\u201d This Statement addresses accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued. FASB ASC 855 requires disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date, the date issued or date available to be issued. The Company adopted this Statement in the second quarter of 2009. As a result the date through which the Company has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date have been disclosed in Note K, Subsequent Events. In April 2009, the FASB issued an update to FASB ASC 820, \\u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures,\\u201d related to providing guidance on when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly. The update clarifies the methodology to be used to determine fair value when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales. The update also reaffirms the objective of fair value measurement, as stated in FASB ASC 820, which is to reflect how much an asset would be sold in and orderly transaction, and the need to use judgment to determine if a formerly active market has become inactive, as well as to determine fair values when markets have become inactive. The Company adopted this Statement in the second quarter of 2009 without significant financial impact. In April 2009, the FASB ASC 320, \\u201cInvestments - Debt and Equity,\\u201d amends current other-than-temporary guidance for debt securities through increased consistency in the timing of impairment recognition and enhanced disclosures related to credit and noncredit components impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold. Also, the Statement increases disclosures for both debt and equity securities regarding expected cash flows, securities with unrealized losses, and credit losses. The Company adopted this Statement in the second quarter of 2009 without significant impact to our financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued an update to FASB ASC 825, \\u201cFinancial Instruments,\\u201d to require interim disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments.\\u201d This update enhances consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures of those assets and liabilities falling within the scope of FASB ASC 825. The Company adopted this update in the second quarter of 2009 without significant impact to the financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued an update to FASB ASC 805, \\u201cBusiness Combinations,\\u201d that clarifies and amends FASB ASC 805, as it applies to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies. This update addresses initial recognition and measurement issues, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosures regarding these assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. The Company adopted this Statement in the second quarter of 2009 without significant impact to the financial statements. In November 2008, EITF issued new guidance under FASB ASC 350, \\u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other on accounting for defensive intangible assets.\\u201d The new guidance applies to all acquired intangible assets in which the acquirer does not intend to actively use the asset but intends to hold (lock up) the asset to prevent its competitors from obtaining or using the asset (a defensive asset). This guidance was adopted by the Company in January 2009 without impact to the financial statements. iTrackr Systems, Inc. (Formerly Must Haves, Inc.)

NOTE J - MERGER On December 10, 2009, Must Haves, Inc., iTrackr Acquisition, Inc. and iTrackr, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger which closed January 12, 2010. On the Closing Date, iTrackr was merged with and into iTrackr Acquisition, Inc. which is the surviving corporation and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Must Haves, Inc. In accordance with the merger agreement, iTrackr\\u2019s stockholder\\u2019s received restricted common stock at the rate of 1:1 share for each of their 17,875,695 shares issued and outstanding in exchange for 100 percent of the outstanding capital stock of iTrackr. In total 19,169,333 shares are outstanding following the closing of the merger. The Merger was accounted for as a \\u201creverse merger,\\u201d as the stockholders of iTrackr, Inc. owned a majority of the outstanding shares of Must Haves, Inc. common stock immediately following the Merger. iTrackr, Inc. was deemed to be the acquirer in the reverse merger. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations of iTrackr, Inc. prior to the Merger are reflected in the financial statements and have been recorded at the historical cost basis of iTrackr, Inc. Our financial statements, after completion of the Merger, include the assets and liabilities of both Must Haves, Inc. and iTrackr, Inc. We accounted for the merger under recapitalization accounting whereby the equity of the acquiring enterprise (iTrackr, Inc.) is presented as the equity of the combined enterprise and the capital stock account of the acquiring enterprise is adjusted to reflect the par value of the outstanding stock of the legal acquirer (Must Haves, Inc.) after giving effect to the number of shares issued in the business combination (1,303,638 shares). Shares retained by the legal acquirer (Must Haves, Inc. 1,303,638 shares) are reflected as an issuance as of the reverse merger date (January 12, 2010) for the historical amount of the net assets of the acquired entity which is in this case is a net liability of $27,515. The following unaudited financial information has been developed by application of pro forma adjustments to the historical financial statements of iTrackr, Inc. appearing elsewhere in this Current Report. The unaudited pro forma information gives effect to the Merger which has been assumed to have occurred on January 1, 2008 for purposes of the statement of operations. The Company evaluated the existence of intangible assets that should be recognized in business combinations, pursuant to ASC 805-20-25-4. No intangible assets were identified.

Notes to Financial Statements For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 NOTE J - MERGER (Continued) The condensed pro forma balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 is as follows: iTrackr Systems, Inc. Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet As of December 31, 2009 1) Due to the nominal assets and operations of Must Haves, Inc. we have accounted for the merger under recapitalization accounting whereby the equity of the acquiring enterprise (iTrackr, Inc.) should be presented as the equity of the combined enterprise. However, the capital stock account of the acquiring enterprise is adjusted to reflect the par value of the outstanding stock of the legal acquirer (Must Haves, Inc.) after giving effect to the number of shares issued in the business combination (1,303,638 shares). Shares retained by the legal acquirer (Must Haves, Inc. 1,303,638 shares) are reflected as an issuance as of the reverse merger date (January 12, 2010) for the historical amount of the net assets of the acquired entity which is in this case is a net liability of $27,515. iTrackr Systems, Inc. (Formerly Must Haves, Inc.) Notes to Financial Statements For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 NOTE K - INCOME TAXES For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company incurred net operating losses and, accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been recorded. In addition, no benefit for income taxes has been recorded due to the uncertainty of the realization of any tax assets. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had approximately $2,755,000 and $2,250,000, respectively of accumulated federal net operating losses. The net operating loss carryforwards, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2026. The components of the Company\\u2019s deferred tax asset are as follows: For financial reporting purposes, the Company has incurred a loss since its inception. Based on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company provided for a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010. A reconciliation between the amounts of income tax benefit determined by applying the applicable U.S. and State statutory income tax rate to pre-tax loss is as follows: NOTE L - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS As of December 31, 2009, the Company was party to a lawsuit brought by Marc Falcone. In this action, Mr. Falcone asserted numerous claims against certain defendants arising out of his former service to iTrackr, Inc. as a contracted consultant. The Company asserted numerous defenses and affirmative defenses, including, but not limited to, the fact that Falcone failed to fulfill his obligations under the agreement. On February 16, 2010, the Company and Mr. Falcone executed a settlement agreement without either side admitting fault. The terms of the settlement agreement call for the payment of $25,000 and the issuance of 360,000 shares of common stock in exchange for a full release of all claims. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has paid all monies and issued all stock related to this settlement.

(and subsidiaries) (the Company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders\\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinion The Company\\u2019s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company\\u2019s auditor since 2013.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE A - General Business Description We are a leading provider of cloud-based supply chain management solutions, providing network-proven fulfillment, sourcing and item assortment management solutions, along with comprehensive retail performance analytics to thousands of customers worldwide. We provide our solutions through the SPS Commerce Platform, a cloud-based product suite that improves the way retailers, suppliers, distributors and logistics firms orchestrate the sourcing, set up of new vendors and items, and fulfillment of the products that consumers buy. We derive the majority of our revenues from thousands of monthly recurring subscriptions from businesses that utilize our solutions. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d) and include the accounts of SPS Commerce, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, with the resulting translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates during the year. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, if any, are included in net income (loss). Use of Estimates Preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Business Combinations We recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Assets acquired include tangible and intangible assets. We use estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable as a part of determining the value and useful lives of purchased intangible assets and the purchase price allocation process. While we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Any such adjustments would be recorded as an offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair values, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments would be recorded in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Segment Information We operate in and report on one segment, which is supply chain management solutions. Risk and Uncertainties We rely on hardware and software licensed from third parties to offer our on-demand solutions. Our management believes alternate sources are available; however, disruption or termination of these relationships could adversely affect our operating results in the near term. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits and trade accounts receivable. Temporary cash investments are held with financial institutions that we believe are subject to minimal risk. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than 90 days. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. Investments Management determines the appropriate classification of certificates of deposit and marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. When a determination has been made that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred, the amount of the decline that is related to a credit loss is realized and is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, which include cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued expenses, approximates fair value due to their short maturities. Marketable securities are recorded at fair value as further described in Note C. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are initially recorded upon the sale of solutions to customers. Credit is granted in the normal course of business without collateral. Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which represent estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make the required payments. When determining the allowances for doubtful accounts, we take several factors into consideration including the overall composition of the accounts receivable aging, our prior history of accounts receivable write-offs, the type of customers and our experience with specific customers. We write-off accounts receivable when they are determined to be uncollectible. Changes in the allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including assets acquired under capital lease obligations, are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives when placed in service, which are: Computer equipment and software: 2 to 3 years Office equipment and furniture: 5 to 7 years Leasehold improvements: the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives beyond one year are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We also capitalize and amortize eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred during the development stage. The assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting gain or loss included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Research and Development Research and development costs primarily include maintenance and data conversion activities related to our cloud-based supply chain management solutions and are expensed as incurred. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. We test goodwill for impairment annually at November 30, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test is conducted by comparing the fair value of the net assets with the carrying value of the reporting unit. Fair value is determined using the direct market observation of market price and outstanding equity of the reporting unit at the testing date. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, goodwill may be impaired. If this occurs, the fair value is then allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. This implied fair value is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill and, if it is less, we would recognize an impairment loss. Intangible Assets Assets acquired in business combinations may include identifiable intangible assets such as subscriber relationships and non-competition agreements. We recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired. We have determined the fair value and useful lives of our purchased intangible assets using certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The purchased intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are three to nine years for subscriber relationships, two to five years for non-competition agreements and one to four years for technology and other. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets at the date it is tested for recoverability, whether in use or under development. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Revenue Recognition We generate revenues by providing three types of solutions to our customers; fulfillment, enablement and analytics. Our cloud-based solutions allow our customers to meet their supply chain management requirements. Revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is probable. If collection is not considered probable, revenues are recognized when the fees are collected. Fees related to our fulfillment and analytics solutions consist of two revenue sources: set-up fees and recurring monthly fees. Set-up fees are specific for each connection a customer has with a trading partner and most of our customers have connections with numerous trading partners. Set-up fees are nonrefundable upfront fees that do not have standalone value to our customer and are not separable from the recurring monthly fees. All set-up fees and related costs are deferred and recognized ratably over the average life of the connection between the customer and the trading partner, which is approximately two years. We begin recognizing set-up fee revenue once the connection is established. Set-up fees for which connections have not yet been established are classified as long-term. We continue to evaluate the length of the amortization period as more experience is gained with cancellations and technology changes requested by our customers. It is possible that, in the future, the period over which such subscription set-up fees and costs are amortized may be adjusted. Any change in our estimate of the average connection life will affect our future results of operations. The recurring monthly fees are comprised of both fixed and transaction-based fees that are recognized as earned. Stock-Based Compensation We recognize the cost of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of those awards. This cost is recognized over the period for which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. We estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In valuing share-based awards, judgment is required in determining the expected volatility of common stock and the expected term individuals will hold their share-based awards prior to exercising. The expected volatility of the options is based on the historical volatility of our common stock. The expected term of the options is based on the simplified method which does not consider historical employee exercise behavior. Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in our judgement, there is a less than a 50% likelihood that the deferred tax asset will be utilized. We assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period. Realization of our deferred tax assets is contingent upon future taxable earnings. Accordingly, this assessment requires significant estimates and judgment. If the estimates of future taxable income vary from actual results, our assessment regarding the realization of these deferred tax assets could change. Future changes in the estimated amount of deferred taxes expected to be realized will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements in the period the estimate is changed, with a corresponding adjustment to our operating results. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would \\u201cmore likely than not\\u201d sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the \\u201cmore likely than not\\u201d threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. Net Income (Loss) Per Share Basic net income (loss) per share has been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted net income (loss) per share also includes the impact of our outstanding potential common shares, including options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards. Potential common shares that are anti-dilutive are excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\\u201cASU\\u201d) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\\u201cASU 2016-09\\u201d). The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows within operating activities. The standard also allows entities to repurchase more of an employee\\u2019s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee\\u2019s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on the statements of cash flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2016-09 during the year ended December 31, 2017. The impact to our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2017 was a $16.3 million increase in deferred income tax assets and a corresponding $16.3 million decrease in accumulated deficit. This impact results from the cumulative-effect adjustment for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits using the modified retrospective method required by the new standard. We elected to adopt the changes in cash flow statement presentation prospectively to be consistent with the prospective transition for the treatment of excess tax benefits in the income statement. Accordingly, we no longer classify excess tax benefits as a financing activity subsequent to January 1, 2017. On December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\\u201cSEC\\u201d) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\\u201cSAB 118\\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP related to the enactment of the comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\\u201cTax Act\\u201d). This guidance was adopted in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additional information regarding our adoption of this guidance is contained in Note J. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. These new requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The new revenue recognition standard will not materially impact our recognition of the primary fees received from customers for our cloud-based supply chain solutions. The adoption of the new standard will impact our accounting for certain upfront set-up fees and the periods over which the related revenues are recognized, as well as the timing of cost recognition for some sales commissions. When compared to previously reported amounts, revenue will decrease $0.5 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Commission expense, which is reported in sales and marketing expense, will decrease $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and increase $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which will supersede existing lease guidance and will require all leases with a term greater than 12 months to be recognized in the statements of financial position and eliminate current real estate-specific lease guidance, while maintaining substantially similar classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases. This standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We believe the adoption of the new lease accounting standard will materially impact our consolidated financial statements by increasing our non-current assets and non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets in order to record the right of use assets and related lease liabilities for our existing operating leases. We are in the process of determining the financial statement impact and are currently unable to estimate the impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which simplifies the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount based on the excess of a reporting unit\\u2019s carrying amount over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in periods beginning after December 15, 2019 on a prospective basis, and earlier adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We believe the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. NOTE B - Business Acquisitions Toolbox Solutions, Inc. On January 5, 2016, we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding common shares of Toolbox Solutions, Inc. (\\u201cToolbox Solutions\\u201d), a privately held company providing point-of-sale analytics and category management services to retailers and consumer packaged goods suppliers in North America. This acquisition expanded our retail network and strengthened our analytics offerings. Pursuant to the share purchase agreement, we paid $18.0 million in cash and issued $2.9 million in stock, or 43,953 shares of common stock, to the shareholders of Toolbox Solutions. The purchase agreement also allowed the sellers to receive up to 16,222 additional shares of common stock, which would have become payable contingent upon the completion of certain revenue milestones, none of which were met, and therefore, no additional shares were issued. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized other income of $1.1 million in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income due to the remeasurement of this contingent liability. Purchase Price Allocation We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination. We allocated the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. We engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist us in the determination of the value of the purchased intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is attributed to a trained workforce and other buyer-specific value resulting from expected synergies, including long-term cost savings, which are not included in the fair values of identifiable assets. The purchase price consisted of the following (in thousands): The final purchase price was subject to a net working capital adjustment to be determined by the sellers and us, pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement. The number of shares of our common stock issued for the acquisition was a net of 43,953 shares, which consisted of 48,668 shares issued at closing, as calculated according to the terms of the purchase agreement, less 4,715 shares that were returned to us from escrow in the fourth quarter of 2016. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired, net of cash acquired of $0.4 million, and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (in thousands): Purchased Intangible Assets The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the purchased intangible assets and their estimated useful lives: The purchased intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense for the period from January 5, 2016 through December 31, 2016 was $1.4 million. Acquisition-Related Costs and Post-Acquisition Operating Results Acquisition-related costs were $0.1 million and are included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2016. The operating results of Toolbox Solutions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since January 5, 2016, the closing date of the acquisition. For the period from January 5, 2016 through December 31, 2016, approximately $7.9 million of our revenues were derived from Toolbox Solutions\\u2019 products and services. The amount of operating income or loss from Toolbox Solutions was not separately identifiable due to our integration. Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below presents the combined operating results of SPS Commerce and Toolbox Solutions as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma information includes the historical operating results of each company and pro forma adjustments for the approximately $1.4 million of annual amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets and the additional impact on the provision or benefit for income taxes, resulting from the combined income and intangible amortization expense, using our statutory blended income tax rate of 26.5%. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have actually been reported had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015, nor is it necessarily indicative of our results of operations for any future periods. NOTE C - Financial Instruments We invest primarily in money market funds, certificates of deposit, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and U.S. corporate debt securities. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are classified as cash equivalents. All investments with original maturities greater than 90 days and remaining maturities less than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments. Investments with remaining maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments. Our short- and long-term marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. We intend to hold marketable securities until maturity; however, we may sell these securities at any time for use in current operations or for other purposes. Consequently, we may or may not keep securities with stated holding periods to maturity. Our marketable securities are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses on these investments, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains or losses are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. When a determination has been made that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred, the amount of the decline that is related to a credit loss is realized and is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments consisted of the following (in thousands): We do not believe any of the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on our assessment of available evidence as of December 31, 2017. We expect to receive the full principal and interest on all of these cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments. Fair Value Measurements We measure certain financial assets at fair value on a recurring basis based on a fair value hierarchy that requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument\\u2019s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: \\u2022 Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \\u2022 Level 2 - observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, (b) quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or (c) model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We obtain the fair values of our level 2 available-for-sale securities from a professional pricing service. \\u2022 Level 3 - unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. The following table presents information about our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value (in thousands): NOTE D - Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts activity, included in accounts receivable, net, was as follows (in thousands): NOTE E - Property and Equipment, net Property and equipment, net included the following (in thousands): At December 31, 2017 and 2016, property and equipment, net included approximately $2.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of assets held at subsidiary and office locations outside of the U.S. NOTE F - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net The changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in thousands): Intangible assets, net included the following (in thousands): Amortization expense was $4.6 million, $4.7 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2017, future amortization expense for intangible assets was as follows (in thousands): NOTE G - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Leases We are obligated under non-cancellable operating leases primarily for office space. Rent expense for all operating leases, which includes minimum lease payments and other charges such as common area maintenance fees, charged to operations was $4.9 million, $5.0 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. On December 20, 2017, we executed the fourth amendment to our lease agreement for our current headquarters located in Minneapolis, Minnesota where we lease approximately 166,000 square feet under an agreement that expires on April 30, 2025. We have agreed to expand our headquarters premises by approximately 48,000 square feet during 2018 and 2020. Our lease agreement also includes a further expansion right and a right of first offer to lease certain additional space and two options to extend the term of the lease for five years at a market rate determined in accordance with the lease. We received $3.2 million in incentives upon execution of the amendment which have been incorporated into our deferred rent calculation. At December 31, 2017, our future minimum payments under operating leases were as follows (in thousands): Other Contingencies We may be involved in various claims and legal actions in the normal course of business. Our management believes that the outcome of any such claims and legal actions will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE H - Stockholders\\u2019 Equity Common Stock Issued In connection with the acquisition of Toolbox Solutions (see Note B), we issued a net of 43,953 shares which consisted of 48,668 shares issued at closing, as calculated according to the terms of the purchase agreement, less 4,715 shares that were returned to us from escrow in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fair value of the shares we issued, approximately $2.9 million, was determined using the closing price of our common stock on January 5, 2016. During the second quarter of 2017, 8,866 shares were returned from escrow pursuant to the agreement with Toolbox Solutions. Stock Repurchase Program On November 2, 2017, our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $50.0 million of common stock. Under the program, purchases may be made from time to time in the open market over the next two years. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the price of our common stock, general business and market conditions and other investment considerations and factors. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. We intend to finance the share repurchase program with cash on hand. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we repurchased 122,147 shares at a cost of $5.8 million. As of December 31, 2017, $44.2 million of the $50.0 million share repurchases authorized was available for future share repurchases. NOTE I - Stock-Based Compensation Our equity compensation plans provide for the grant of incentive and nonqualified stock options, as well as other stock-based awards including restricted stock and restricted stock units, to employees, non-employee directors and other consultants who provide services to us. Restricted stock awards result in the issuance of new shares when granted. For other stock-based awards, new shares are issued when the award is exercised, vested or released according to the terms of the agreement. In February 2017 and February 2016, 1,024,868 and 1,003,439 additional shares, respectively, were reserved for future issuance under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. At December 31, 2017, there were approximately 4.6 million shares available for grant under approved equity compensation plans. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $12.7 million, $8.0 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, stock-based compensation expense included a $3.6 million charge due to immediate expensing of equity awards upon our Chief Executive Officer meeting certain age and years of service conditions. Stock-based compensation expense was allocated as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2017, there was approximately $11.6 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense under our equity compensation plans, which is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years. Stock Options Stock options generally vest over four years and have a contractual term of seven to ten years from the date of grant. Our stock option activity was as follows: Of the total outstanding options at December 31, 2017, 743,471 were exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $44.58 per share. The total outstanding options had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.0 years. The fair value of options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $4.2 million, $3.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $2.8 million, $8.6 million and $16.8 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of outstanding options at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $7.3 million, $25.6 million and $30.5 million, respectively. The weighted-average fair values per share of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $18.85, $16.13 and $23.09, respectively. The fair values of the options granted were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: The expected volatility of the options is based on the historical volatility of our common stock. We have not issued dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The expected term of the options is based on the simplified method which does not consider historical employee exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at the grant date. Performance Share Units and Restricted Stock Units and Awards In February 2017, our executive officers were granted performance share unit (\\u201cPSU\\u201d) awards with vesting contingent on successful attainment of predetermined revenue targets over the course of a three-year performance period. No expense for PSU awards was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017 as the probability of attainment of the revenue target decreased. Restricted stock units (\\u201cRSU\\u201d) vest over four years and, upon vesting, the holder is entitled to receive shares of our common stock. With restricted stock awards (\\u201cRSA\\u201d), shares of our common stock are issued when the award is granted and the restrictions lapse over one year. Our PSU and RSU activity was as follows: The number of PSUs and RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2017 included 44,177 units that have vested, but the shares of common stock have not yet been issued pursuant to the terms of the agreement. Our RSA activity was as follows: Employee Stock Purchase Plan Effective July 1, 2012, we adopted an employee stock purchase plan which allows participating employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The plan is available to all employees subject to certain eligibility requirements. Participating employees may purchase common stock, on a voluntary after tax basis, at a price that is the lower of 85% of the fair market value of one share of common stock at the beginning or end of each stock purchase period. The plan consists of two six-month offering periods, beginning on January 1 and July 1 of each calendar year. A total of 1.0 million shares of common stock are remaining for issuance under the plan. For the offering periods in 2017, 2016 and 2015, we withheld approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, from employees participating in the plan and purchased 40,968 shares, 33,357 shares and 28,362 shares, respectively, on their behalf. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded approximately $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense associated with the employee stock purchase plan. The fair value was estimated based on the market price of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period and using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: NOTE J - Income Taxes Our provisions for income taxes included current federal, foreign and state income tax expense, as well as deferred tax expense as follows (in thousands): The current federal provision in the table above includes a $0.4 million reclass of alternative minimum tax (\\u201cAMT\\u201d) credit carryforwards from the deferred federal provision. These unutilized AMT credit carryforwards become partially refundable in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and fully refundable in 2022. A reconciliation of the expected federal income tax at the statutory rate to the provision for income taxes was as follows (in thousands): The tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes tax benefits of $0.9 million for the excess tax deduction from stock activity. It also includes tax expense of $8.6 million related to The Job Cuts and Tax Act (\\u201cTax Act\\u201d), primarily due to the reduction in corporate tax rate to 21.0% resulting in a decrease in our U.S. net deferred tax assets. Differences between our effective tax rate and statutory tax rates are primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act, as well as permanently non-deductible expenses partially offset by the federal research and development credit. Additionally, under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits generated upon settlement or exercise of stock awards are now recognized as a reduction to income tax expense as a discrete tax item in the period that the event occurs creating potentially significant fluctuation in tax expense by year. The significant components of our deferred tax assets (liabilities) were as follows (in thousands): As of December 31, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $58.5 million for U.S. federal tax purposes. We also had $10.6 million of various state net operating loss carryforwards. The loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes will expire between 2020 and 2036 if not utilized. The loss carryforwards for state tax purposes will expire between 2018 and 2036 if not utilized. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. We have performed a Section 382 analysis for the time period from our inception through December 8, 2010. During this time period it was determined that we had six separate ownership changes under Section 382. We have not updated the Section 382 analysis subsequent to December 8, 2010, however, we believe there have not been any events subsequent to that date that would materially impact the analysis. We believe that approximately $17.6 million of federal losses will expire unused due to Section 382 limitations. The maximum annual limitation of federal net operating losses under Section 382 is approximately $1.0 million. This limitation could be further restricted if any ownership changes occur in future years. Accordingly, our deferred tax assets are reported net of the excess tax deductions for stock compensation and Section 382 limitations. As of December 31, 2017 we had federal research and development credit carryforwards, net of Section 383 limitations, of $1.2 million, which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2030. We had state research and development credit carryforwards of $0.6 million which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2025. As of December 31, 2017, we had a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of $0.6 million. The valuation allowance is established for state net operating loss and credit carryforwards that we do not expect to utilize based on our current expectations of future state taxable income. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal, various state and international jurisdictions. We are generally subject to U.S. federal and state tax examinations for all prior tax years due to our net operating loss carryforwards and the utilization of the carryforwards in years still open under statute. As of December 31, 2017, we do not have any unrecognized tax benefits. It is our practice to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. We do not expect any material changes in our unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months. Tax Act The Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, includes broad and complex changes to the U.S tax code. The Tax Act reduces the corporate federal income tax rate to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018 and establishes a mandatory tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits (\\u201cE&P\\u201d). The Tax Act expands the limitations for executive compensation under Section 162(m) and includes transition rules for previously awarded compensation. Accounting Standard Codification 740 requires a company to record the effects of a tax law change in the period of enactment, however, the SEC staff issued SAB 118, which allows a company to record a provisional amount when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in the tax law. The measurement period ends when the company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year. We have finalized our accounting for the corporate rate reduction and have recorded a decrease to our net deferred tax assets of $8.6 million with a corresponding adjustment to deferred tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. We have estimated that there is no tax on mandatory deemed repatriation due to a net foreign E&P deficit. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the Tax Act on the taxation of previously untaxed foreign E&P and the deferred tax liability for withholding taxes on dividends. We are also continuing to evaluate the impact the expanded Section 162(m) limitations and related transition rules have on our deferred tax assets related to stock compensation. NOTE K - Net Income (Loss) Per Share The following table presents the components of the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts): For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the effect of approximately 283,000, 5,000 and 4,000 outstanding potential common shares, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share as they were anti-dilutive. NOTE L - Retirement Savings Plan We sponsor a 401(k) retirement savings plan for our U.S. employees. Employees can contribute up to 100% of their compensation, subject to the limits established by law. We match 25% of the employee\\u2019s contribution up to the first 6% of pre-tax annual compensation. Additionally, we make statutory contributions to retirement plans as required by local foreign government regulations. Our contributions to the plans, which vest immediately, were $1.6 million, $1.4 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. NOTE M - Related Party Transactions SPS Commerce Foundation (the \\u201cFoundation\\u201d) is a Minnesota non-profit organization exempt from federal taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Foundation was formed in 2015 to engage in, advance, support, promote and administer charitable activities. The directors of the Foundation are also our officers. These officers receive no compensation from the Foundation for the management services performed for the Foundation. The Foundation is not a subsidiary of ours and the financial results of the Foundation are not consolidated with our financial statements. We made contributions of $0.2 million and $0.3 million to the Foundation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We have no current legal obligations for future commitments to the Foundation.

CREDEX CORPORATION DECEMBER 31, To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Credex Corporation We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Credex Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and the related statement of operations, stockholders\\u2019 equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016. Credex Corporation\\u2019s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Credex Corporation as of December 31, 2016 the results of their operations, and their cash flows, for the year ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses from operations, has negative working capital and is in need of additional capital to grow its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note B. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. /s/ KLJ & Associates, LLP KLJ & Associates, LLP Edina, MN March 30, 2017 MICHAEL GILLESPIE & ASSOCIATES, PLLC CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 10544 ALTON AVE NE SEATTLE, WA 98125 206.353.5736 To the Board of Directors Credex Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Credex Corporation as of December 31, 2017 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders\\u2019 deficit and cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as \\u201cfinancial statements\\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial statements of Credex Corporation as of December 31, 2016, were audited by other auditors whose report dated March 30, 2017, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u2019s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management\\u2019s plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note B. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /S/ MICHAEL GILLESPIE & ASSOCIATES, PLLC We have served as the Company\\u2019s auditor since 2017. Seattle, Washington February 22, 2018 CREDEX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL CONDENSED STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization and Purpose Credex Corporation, (the \\\"Company\\\") was incorporated in the State of Florida on September 2, 2005. The company is looking renewable energy and hydrogen technologies and develops new markets. The Company is currently reviewing various technologies. The Company is also exploring avenues for raising capital in order to put its business plan into effect. The Company\\u2019s principal office is in Las Vegas, Nevada. Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements have been in accordance with U.S. GAAP and rules of SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary in order to for the financial statements to be not misleading have been properly reflected herein. Accounting Basis The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d accounting). The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured. Cash and Equivalents For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months to be cash equivalents. Advertising The Company expenses advertising and promotions costs as they are incurred. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the year plus potential dilutive instruments such as stock options and warrants. The Company has no dilutive instruments outstanding. CREDEX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL CONDENSED STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Income Taxes The Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the Codification (\\\"Section 740-10-25\\\") which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Comprehensive Income The Company has which established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. When applicable, the Company would disclose this information on its Statement of Stockholders\\u2019 Equity. Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company has not had any significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive income. CREDEX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\\u2019s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, the carrying value of accounts payable and loans that are required to be measured at fair value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update \\u201cASU\\u201d 2014-15 on \\u201cPresentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\\u201d. Currently, there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management\\u2019s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management\\u2019s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management\\u2019s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. CREDEX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, NOTE B - GOING CONCERN The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company\\u2019s financial position and operating results raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has sustained losses of $358,079 since inception to December 31, 2017. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon expanding operations and obtaining additional capital and financing. Management\\u2019s plan in this regard is to implement the Company\\u2019s business plan and to secure additional funds through equity or debt financing. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE C - STOCKHOLDER LOANS - RELATED PARTIES The Company received loans from Service Merchants Corp, a related party, towards operating expenses. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, $9,700 was due to Service Merchant Corp. The Company received loans from a shareholder of the company through Global Merchant Corp, a related party, towards various operating expenses. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, $12,889 was due to Global Merchant Corp.

As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, $198 was due to Earth Wind Power Corp. NOTE D - CAPITAL STOCK At inception on September 2, 2005, the Company was authorized to have outstanding 10,000 shares of common stock at $0.10 par value per share. On October 24, 2007, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase the maximum number of authorized common shares to 100,000,000 and changed the par value to $0.001 per share, which has been retro-actively restated to $0.001 in the accompanying financial statements. On September 13, 2013, the Company received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\\u201cFINRA\\u201d) clearing a ten to one (10:1) forward stock split previously approved by the Company\\u2019s board of directors. The record Date for the forward stock split is September 16, 2013 which resulted in an increase in the number of shares issued and outstanding from 5,899,250 to 58,992,500 shares. All reference to shares and per share amounts in the accompanying financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the aforementioned forward stock split. There were 58,992,500 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016. NOTE E - COMMITMENTS The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property. An officer has provided office services without charge. There is no obligation for the officer to continue this arrangement. Such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and accordingly are not reflected herein. The officers and directors are involved in other business activities and most likely will become involved in other business activities in the future. CREDEX CORPORATION NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, NOTE F - INCOME TAXES For the period ended December 31, 2017, the Company has incurred net losses and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately $358,079 at December 31, 2017, and will expire beginning of the year 2025. The provision for Federal income tax consists of the following for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: The cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 21% and 34% respectively of significant items comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows as of December 31, 2017 and 2016: Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $358,079 for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years. NOTE G - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to December 31, 2017 to the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.\",\n          \"AFC Building Technologies Inc.

Statements of Operations The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. AFC Building Technologies Inc. Statements of Cash Flows The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. AFC Building Technologies Inc. Statements of Stockholders\\u2019 Deficit The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. AFC BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES INC. Notes to Financial Statements 1. Nature of Operations AFC Building Technologies Inc. (the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 10, 2011. Effective January 10, 2014, the Company changed its name from Auto Tool Technologies Inc. to AFC Building Technologies Inc. The Company was engaged in the sales and distribution of hand tools in Canada. The Company is in the process of determining a new line of business. 2. Going Concern These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders and note holders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and ultimately the attainment of profitable operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has not generated any revenues, has a working capital deficit of $177,070, and has an accumulated deficit of $413,199 since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies a) Basis of Presentation These financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and are expressed in US dollars. The Company\\u2019s fiscal year-end is December 31. b) Use of Estimates The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuations and loss contingencies. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company\\u2019s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. c) Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. d) Financial Instruments/Concentrations The Company\\u2019s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable, and due to related party. Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, the fair value of cash equivalents are determined based on \\u201cLevel 1\\u201d inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the recorded values of all of the Company\\u2019s other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and relatively short maturity dates or durations. AFC BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES INC. Notes to Financial Statements continued 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies e) Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Company and the reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar. Gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated transactions included in the determination of income. Foreign currency transactions are primarily undertaken in Canadian dollars. The Company has not, to the date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. f) Comprehensive Income (Loss) ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income (loss) and its components in the financial statements. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had no comprehensive income. g) Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company did not have any dilutive potential shares outstanding at December 31, 2017 or 2016. h) Income Taxes Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740, Income Taxes, as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740 the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in these financial statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. i) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements. Additionally, the Company has considered all pronouncements issued but not yet effective and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 4. Related Party Transactions a) At December 31, 2017, the Company owed $8,358 (2016 - $7,963) to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. These were monies advanced for general working capital purposes, (i.e. accounting and professional fees) as required. The amount is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. b) At December 31, 2017, the Company owed $46,157 (2016 - $36,861) to a shareholder of the Company. These were monies advanced for general working capital purposes, (i.e. accounting and professional fees) as required. The amount is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. c) During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $0 (2016 - $3,747) of contractor expenses to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. AFC BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES INC. Notes to Financial Statements continued 5. Licensing Agreement On June 30, 2015, the Company entered into a license agreement with a shareholder of the Company. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company received an exclusive worldwide license in regards to 15 domain names related to the automotive e-commerce business for a period of 40 years. In consideration for the granting of the license, the Company will pay to the licensor a royalty of 2.5% of gross sales for any revenue derived from the use of the licensed domains. 6. Income Taxes The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 which reduced the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018. The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate of 21% to loss before income taxes as follows at December 31: Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in the tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. At December 31, 2017, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $206,500 that may be offset against future taxable income from the year 2018 through 2031. This results in a deferred tax asset of $43,367 as of December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $150,000. This results in a deferred tax asset of $31,447 as of December 31, 2016. The Company has fully allowed for these assets as of the years then ended. The valuation allowance is estimated to be approximately $43,367 and $31,447 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 7. Subsequent Events a) On February 22, 2018, the Company completed the non-brokered private placement of 2,000,000 common shares at a purchase price of $0.25 per share for gross proceeds of $500,000. b) Effective February 14, 2018, Cindy Lee Kelly resigned as Director, President and CEO of our Company. Ms. Kelly will remain as CFO, Secretary and Treasurer. The resignation of Ms. Kelly was not the result of any disagreement with our Company regarding our operations, policies, practices or otherwise. On February 14, 2018, we appointed Christopher Hansen as Director, President and CEO\",\n          \"Page Part I - Financial Information Financial Statements Consolidated Balance Sheets Consolidated Statements of Operations Consolidated Statement of Stockholders\\u2019 Equity Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows The information set forth below should be read together with \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Phoenix, Arizona December 20, 2018 We have served as the Company's auditor since fiscal year 2000.

Organization and Operations The Company Mesa Air Group, Inc. (\\u201cMesa\\u201d or the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) is a holding company whose principal subsidiary operates as a regional air carrier, providing scheduled passenger service. As of September 30, 2018, the Company served 110 cities in 39 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, Mexico, Cuba and the Bahamas, and operated a fleet of 145 aircraft with approximately 730 daily departures. The Company\\u2019s airline operations are conducted by its regional airline subsidiary, Mesa Airlines, Inc. (\\u201cMesa Airlines\\u201d), providing services to major air carriers under capacity purchase agreements. Mesa Airlines operates as American Eagle under a capacity purchase agreement with American Airlines, Inc. (\\u201cAmerican\\u201d) and as United Express under a capacity purchase agreement with United Airlines, Inc. (\\u201cUnited\\u201d). All of the Company\\u2019s consolidated contract revenues for years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were derived from operations associated with these two capacity purchase agreements. The financial arrangements between the Company and its major airline partners involve a revenue-guarantee arrangement (i.e. a \\u201ccapacity purchase agreement\\u201d) whereby the major airline pays a monthly guaranteed amount for each aircraft under contract, a fixed fee for each block hour and flight flown and reimbursement of certain direct operating expenses in exchange for providing regional flying. The major airline partners also pay certain expenses directly to suppliers, such as fuel, ground operations and certain landing fees. Under the terms of these capacity purchase agreements, the major airline controls route selection, pricing and seat inventories, thereby reducing the Company\\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in passenger traffic, fare levels, and fuel prices. On August 8, 2018, the Company filed its Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which, among other things: (i) effected a 2.5-for-1 stock split of its common stock; and (ii) increased the authorized number of shares of its common and preferred stock to 125,000,000 and 5,000,000, respectively. All references to share and per share amounts in the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively revised to reflect the stock split and increase in authorized shares. On August 14, 2018, the Company completed an initial public offering (\\u201cIPO\\u201d) of its common stock, in which it issued and sold 9,630,000 shares (the \\u201cFirm Shares\\u201d) of common stock at a public offering price of $12.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $115.6 million. Additionally, in connection with the IPO, the Company granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 1,444,500 shares of common stock at the same price. On September 11, 2018, the Company closed the sale of 1,344,500 shares (\\u201cOption Shares\\u201d) of its common stock, in connection with the partial exercise of the overallotment option granted to the underwriters in its IPO. Of the 1,344,500 Option Shares sold, 723,985 were purchased directly from the Company and the remaining 620,515 shares were purchased directly from the selling shareholders. The Firm Shares and Option Shares were sold to the public for a price of $12.00 per share. The sale of these shares raised gross proceeds of approximately $124,247,820. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Option Shares by the selling shareholders. As part of the IPO, stock appreciation rights (\\u201cSARs\\u201d) previously issued under the Mesa Air Group, Inc. Amended and Restated Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (the \\u201cSAR Plan\\u201d), which settled only in cash, were cancelled and exchanged for an aggregate of 1,266,034 shares of restricted common stock under the Company\\u2019s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the \\u201c2018 Plan\\u201d) (see note 12), of which 966,022 were fully vested upon issuance and are included in the number of shares of common stock outstanding after the IPO. Of the 966,022 fully vested shares, 314,198 shares were retained by the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations, resulting in a net issuance of 651,824 shares. Additionally, 983,113 shares of restricted common stock were issued to certain of its employees and directors under its 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of 491,915 shares of existing unvested restricted phantom stock units and 491,198 shares of restricted stock under the 2011 and 2017 Plans, respectively. American Capacity Purchase Agreement As of September 30, 2018, the Company operated 64 CRJ-900 aircraft for American under a capacity purchase agreement. Unless otherwise extended or amended, the capacity purchase agreement for the aircraft expires between 2021 and 2025. In exchange for providing flights and all other services under the agreement, the Company receives a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft, plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours (the number of hours during which the aircraft is in revenue service, measured from the time of gate departure before take-off until the time of gate arrival at the destination) flown during the month. In addition, the Company may also receive incentives or pay penalties based upon the Company\\u2019s operational performance, including controllable on-time departure and controllable completion percentages. American also reimburses the Company for the actual amount incurred for certain items such as passenger liability and hull insurance, and aircraft property taxes. In addition, American also provides, at no cost to the Company, certain ground handling and customer service functions, as well as airport-related facilities and fuel. The Company also receives a monthly profit margin payment from American based on the number of aircraft operating. The capacity purchase agreement is subject to early termination for cause under specified circumstances and subject to the Company\\u2019s right to cure under certain conditions. American had a 7.2% and 10.6% ownership interest in the Company, calculated on a fully-diluted basis as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The related party amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations pertain to American. United Capacity Purchase Agreement As of September 30, 2018, the Company operated 20 CRJ-700 and 60 E-175 aircraft for United under a capacity purchase agreement. Subject to certain early termination rights, the capacity purchase agreement for each of the 20 CRJ-700 aircraft expires between August and December 2019. Subject to early termination rights, the capacity purchase agreement for 30 of the E-175 aircraft (owned by United) expires between June 2019 and August 2020, subject to United\\u2019s right to extend for four additional two-year terms (maximum of eight years). Subject to early termination rights, the capacity purchase agreement for 18 of the E-175 aircraft (owned by Mesa) expires between January 2028 and November 2028. During fiscal 2017, the Company and United expanded the capacity purchase agreement to include, subject to early termination rights, an additional 12 E-175 aircraft (purchased by United) with the aircraft entering service through January 2018 for five-year terms, subject to United\\u2019s right to extend for four additional two-year terms (maximum of eight years). In exchange for performing the flight services under such agreement, the Company receives from United a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft, plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown during the month. Additionally, certain costs incurred by the Company in performing the flight services are \\u201cpass-through\\u201d costs, whereby United agrees to reimburse the Company for the actual amounts incurred for the following items: property tax per aircraft, landing fees, and additionally for the E-175 aircraft owned by United, heavy airframe and engine maintenance, landing gear, APUs and component maintenance. The Company also receives a profit margin based upon certain reimbursable costs under the agreement, as well as its operational performance in addition to a fixed profit margin. The capacity purchase agreement is also subject to early termination for cause under specified circumstances and subject to the Company\\u2019s right to cure under certain circumstances. United is also permitted, subject to certain conditions, to terminate the agreement early in its discretion by giving us notice of 90 days or more. In February 2018, the Company mutually agreed with United to temporarily remove two aircraft from service under its United capacity purchase agreement until the Company was able to fully staff flight operations. During the temporary removal, the Company agreed to pay the lease costs associated with the two E-175 aircraft, which totaled $1.9 million as of September 30, 2018. In June 2018, the Company was able to fully staff flight operations and these two E-175 aircraft were placed back into service under the United capacity purchase agreement. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative United States generally accepted accounting principles as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (\\u201cASC\\u201d) and Accounting Standards Update (\\u201cASU\\u201d) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\u201cFASB\\u201d). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company is an \\u201cemerging growth company,\\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \\u201cJOBS Act\\u201d) and may remain an emerging growth company until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO, subject to specified conditions. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. The Company has elected to \\u201copt out\\u201d of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Segment Reporting Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In consideration of ASC 280, \\u201cSegment Reporting,\\u201d we are not organized around specific services or geographic regions. We currently operate in one service line providing scheduled passenger services in accordance with our capacity purchase agreements. While we operate under two separate capacity purchase agreements, we do not manage our business based on any performance measure at the individual contract level. Additionally, our chief operating decision maker uses consolidated financial information to evaluate our performance, which is the same basis on which he communicates our results and performance to our Board of Directors. He bases all significant decisions regarding the allocation of our resources on a consolidated basis. Based on the information described above and in accordance with the applicable literature, management has concluded that we are organized and operated as one operating and reportable segment. All of our operating revenue in our 2018, 2017 and 2016 fiscal years was derived from operations associated with our American and United Capacity Purchase Agreements. It is currently impractical to provide certain information on our revenue from our customers for each of our services and geographic information on our revenues and long lived assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Marketable Securities The Company\\u2019s investments in marketable securities are deemed by management to be available-for-sale and are reported at fair market value. The Company\\u2019s holdings of marketable securities as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $19.9 million and $0, respectively. Restricted Cash Restricted cash primarily includes deposits in trust accounts to collateralize letters of credit and to fund workers\\u2019 compensation claims, landing fees, and other business needs. Restricted cash is stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company has an agreement with a financial institution for a $6.0 million letter of credit facility to issue letters of credit for landing fees, workers\\u2019 compensation insurance, and other business needs. Pursuant to such agreement, $3.8 million and $3.6 million of outstanding letters of credit are required to be collateralized by amounts on deposit as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which are classified as restricted cash. Expendable Parts and Supplies Expendable parts and supplies are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or market, and are charged to expense as they are used. The Company provides an allowance for obsolescence for such parts and supplies over the useful life of its aircraft after considering the useful life of each aircraft fleet, the estimated cost of expendable parts expected to be on hand at the end of the useful life, and the estimated salvage value of the parts. This allowance was $1.8 million and $1.6 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Prepaid Expenses Prepaid expenses consist primarily of the excess of aircraft lease payments over the straight-lined lease expense. The straight-lined lease expense is net of estimated rebates to be received from the lessor during the term of the agreements, contingent on the Company performing certain engine restorations. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of manufacturer incentives, and depreciated over their estimated useful lives to their estimated salvage values, which are 20% for aircraft and rotable spare parts, using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives of the various classifications of property and equipment are as follows: Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired. The Company records an impairment loss if (i) the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, and (ii) the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds fair value. If an impairment loss has occurred, a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. The Company recognized no impairment charges on property and equipment for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. Fair Value Measurements The Company accounts for assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting standards that define fair value and establish a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Accounting standards include disclosure requirements relating to the fair values used for certain financial instruments and establish a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes valuation inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of three levels: \\u2022 Level 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; \\u2022 Level 2 - Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and \\u2022 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. Prepaid Maintenance Deposits Prepaid maintenance deposits consist of payments made on a monthly basis to cover certain future maintenance events for leased flight equipment. The deposits are contractual obligations that are held in trust by the lessors. The deposits are only to be used to cover maintenance events, which include, among other things, C-checks, engine restoration events, engine life limited parts, landing gear repairs, and auxiliary power unit overhauls. The Company expenses the service as it is performed and receives reimbursement from the reserve trust account. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the noncurrent portion is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Debt Financing Costs Debt financing costs consist of payments made to issue debt related to the purchase of aircraft, flight equipment, and certain flight equipment maintenance costs. The Company defers the costs and amortizes them over the term of the debt agreement. Debt financing costs related to a recognized debt liability are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. Debt financing costs with no related recognized debt liability are presented as assets, with the current portion included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the noncurrent portion included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Unutilized Manufacturer Credits Manufacturer credits received in connection with aircraft purchases that can be used for the future purchase of certain goods and services are recorded as a prepaid asset based on the value of the credits expected to be utilized, and the Company reduces the asset as the credits are utilized to fund such purchases. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the noncurrent portion is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Intangibles In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, an intangible asset with a finite life that is being amortized is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired. The Company records an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset and if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds fair value. If an impairment loss has occurred, a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. Other Assets Other long-term assets primarily consist of noncurrent deferred reimbursed costs, debt financing costs, and prepaid maintenance deposits. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in future years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records deferred tax assets for the value of benefits expected to be realized from the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, and state and federal net operating loss carryforwards. The Company periodically reviews these assets to determine the likelihood of realization. To the extent the Company believes some portion of the benefit may not be realizable, an estimate of the unrealized position is made and a valuation allowance is recorded. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Deferred Credits Deferred credits consist of cost reimbursements from major airline partners related to aircraft modifications per revised capacity purchase agreements and costs associated with pilot training. The deferred credits are amortized on a straight-line basis as a component of revenue over the term of the respective capacity purchase agreements. Other Noncurrent Liabilities Other noncurrent liabilities consist of the remaining fair value adjustment for unfavorable aircraft operating leases related to a previous bankruptcy and related accounting. This adjustment to fair value is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining initial lease terms for these aircraft. During each of the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded amortization of this unfavorable lease liability of $6.6 million, $6.8 million, and $6.8 million, respectively, as a reduction of lease expense. During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company wrote off $1.2 million of unfavorable lease liability related to the lease termination of its aircraft lease facility with Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National Association, as owner trustee and lessor (the \\u201cGECAS Lease Facility\\u201d), which was accounted for as lease termination expense. Revenue Recognition Under the Company\\u2019s capacity purchase agreements, the major airline partners generally pay a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft, plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown. The contracts also include reimbursement of certain costs incurred by the Company in performing flight services. These costs, known as \\u201cpass-through costs,\\u201d may include passenger and hull insurance, aircraft property taxes, as well as landing fees and catering. Additionally, for the E-175 aircraft owned by United, the capacity purchase agreement provides that United will reimburse the Company for heavy airframe and engine maintenance, landing gear, auxiliary power units (\\u201cAPU\\u201d) and component maintenance which are treated as pass-through and will increase revenue (and expense for the same amount) upon completion of the work. The Company also receives compensation under its capacity purchase agreements for heavy maintenance expenses at a fixed hourly rate or per aircraft rate for all aircraft in scheduled service other than the E-175 aircraft owned by United. The Company records reimbursement of pass-through costs as pass-through and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations as service is provided. In addition, the Company\\u2019s major airline partners also provide, at no cost to the Company, certain ground handling and customer service functions, as well as airport-related facilities and gates at their hubs and other cities. Services and facilities provided by major airline partners at no cost to the Company are presented net in the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements; hence, no amounts are recorded for revenue or expense for these items. The contracts also include a profit margin on certain reimbursable costs, as well as a profit margin, incentives and penalties based on certain operational benchmarks. The Company recognizes revenue under its capacity purchase agreements when the transportation is provided, including an estimate of the profit component based upon the information available at the end of the accounting period. All revenue recognized under these contracts is presented as the gross amount billed to the major airline partners. Under the Company\\u2019s capacity purchase agreements with American and United, the Company is reimbursed under a fixed rate per block hour, plus an amount per aircraft designed to reimburse the Company for certain aircraft ownership costs. The Company has concluded that a component of its revenue under these agreements is rental income, as such agreements identify the \\u201cright of use\\u201d of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period of time. The Company calculates the amount of rental income using the contractual ownership rates set forth in the respective capacity purchase agreements. The amount deemed to be rental income during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $217.0 million, $217.6 million and $190.1 million, respectively, and has been included in contract revenue on the Company\\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. The Company has not separately stated aircraft rental income and aircraft rental expense in the consolidated statements of operations because the use of the aircraft is not a separate activity of the total service provided. Our American and United Capacity Purchase Agreements contain an option that allows the major airline partner to assume the contractual responsibility for procuring and providing the fuel necessary to operate the flights that the Company operates for them. Both airlines have exercised this option. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize fuel expense or revenue for fuel on passenger flight services. Maintenance Expense The Company operates under an FAA approved continuous inspection and maintenance program. The Company uses the direct expense method of accounting for its maintenance of regional jet engine overhauls, airframe, landing gear, and normal recurring maintenance wherein the expense is recognized when the maintenance work is completed, or over the period of repair, if materially different. For leased aircraft, the Company is subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the \\u201clife\\u201d of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date. The Company estimates the cost of maintenance lease return obligations and accrues such costs over the remaining lease term when the expense is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Engine overhaul expense totaled $51.2 million, $64.0 million and $90.9 million for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which $12.3 million, $0.3 million and $0 million was pass-through expense. Airframe check expense totaled $21.5 million, $22.6 million and $13.2 million for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of which $7.5 million, $4.9 million and $0 million was pass-through expense. Pursuant to the United capacity purchase agreement, United reimburses the Company for heavy maintenance on certain E-175 aircraft. Those reimbursements are included in pass-through and other revenue. See Note 1: \\u201cOrganization and Operations\\u201d for further information. Aircraft Leases In addition to the aircraft we receive from United under our Capacity Purchase Agreement, approximately 19% of our aircraft are leased from third parties. In order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease, we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments. These estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease. All of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases, which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the term of the related leases. Additionally, operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and accordingly, neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. In the event that we or one of our major airline partners decide to exit an activity involving leased aircraft, losses may be incurred. In the event that we exit an activity that results in exit losses, these losses are accrued as each aircraft is removed from operations for early termination penalties, lease settle up and other charges. See \\u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\u201d below for a discussion of a new accounting standard that is likely to have an impact on our aircraft lease accounting beginning in 2019. Change in Accounting Policy Stock Appreciation Rights (\\u201cSARs\\u201d) and Phantom Stock historically were accounted for as liability compensatory awards under ASC 710, Compensation - General, valued using the intrinsic value method, as permitted by ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, for nonpublic entities. Upon becoming a public company, as defined in ASC 718, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company was required to change its methodology for valuing the SARs and Phantom Stock. The SARs and Phantom Stock were re-measured at each quarterly reporting date and were accounted for prospectively at fair value using a Black-Scholes fair value pricing model until they were converted to restricted stock awards upon completion of the Company\\u2019s IPO. The Company recorded the impact of the change in valuation methods as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, as permitted by ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The effect of the change increased the SARs and Phantom Stock liability by $2.4 million which was the difference in compensation cost measured using the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. An equal and offsetting change to retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet was recorded with the revaluation. Any future changes in fair value were recorded as compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Upon completion of the Company\\u2019s IPO the SARs and Phantom Stock were cancelled and exchanged for shares of restricted stock under our 2018 Plan. Correction of Immaterial Misstatement Subsequent to the issuance of the Company\\u2019s 2016 consolidated financial statements, management determined that a payment the Company received in 2017 of $4.6 million from a former vendor for engine maintenance support credits should have been recorded as a receivable and a reduction in engine maintenance expense in prior years, and also identified other minor prior period adjustments for under-accrued property tax. Accordingly, the Company made a prior period adjustment to increase retained earnings by $2.3 million as of September 30, 2015 and adjusted accounts receivable, accrued property taxes, and deferred tax liability (for related income tax effects) as of September 30, 2016, to correct such amounts. These adjustments had no effect on the Company\\u2019s previously-reported results of operations or net cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2016. The Company evaluated these adjustments considering both quantitative and qualitative factors and concluded they were immaterial to previously issued financial statements. 3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\\u201cASU 2014-09\\u201d). The standard establishes a new recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU 2014-09 allows the Company to apply the standard either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new standard, making it effective for our reporting periods beginning October 1, 2018. Under the new standard, the Company concluded that individual flights are distinct services and these flight services promised in a capacity purchase agreement represent a series of services that should be accounted for as a single performance obligation, recognized over time as the flights are completed. We do not expect ASU 2014-09 to have a material impact to our financial statements. The Company anticipates applying the standard as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We will continue to monitor industry activities and any additional guidance provided by regulators, standards setters, or the accounting profession and adjust our assessment and implementation plans accordingly. In August 2014, The FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Topic 205), which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the consolidated financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosure if \\u201cconditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity\\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\\u201d The update applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. The Company adopted this ASU in fiscal year 2017, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\\u201cASU 2016-02\\u201d), which provides guidance requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for substantially all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. Leases will be classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. In March of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\\\"ASU 2016-09\\\"). With this standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are required to be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of the year ended September 30, 2018. This change in accounting principle has been applied on a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of fiscal year 2018 as a cumulative-effect adjustment increasing deferred tax assets by $0.4 million, increasing income tax expense by $0.3 million, and increasing retained earnings by $0.7 million. Adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have any other material effect on the Company\\u2019s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force), which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact to its financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 that requires restricted cash and cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects the adoption of ASU 2016-18 to have no effect on our consolidated statements of operations or its consolidated balance sheets. ASU 2016-18 is expected to only result in a change in presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company has restricted cash of $3.8 million and $3.6 million as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and intends to adopt the new guidance in fiscal 2019. 4. Concentrations At September 30, 2018, the Company had capacity purchase agreements with American and United. All of the Company\\u2019s consolidated revenue for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and accounts receivable at the end of September 30, 2018 and 2017 was derived from these agreements. The terms of both the American and United capacity purchase agreements are not aligned with the lease obligations on the aircraft performing services under such agreements. Amounts billed by the Company under capacity purchase agreements are subject to the Company\\u2019s interpretation of the applicable capacity purchase agreement and are subject to audit by the Company\\u2019s major airline partners. Periodically, the Company\\u2019s major airline partners dispute amounts billed and pay amounts less than the amount billed. Ultimate collection of the remaining amounts not only depends upon the Company prevailing under the applicable audit, but also upon the financial well-being of the major airline partner. As such, the Company periodically reviews amounts past due and records a reserve for amounts estimated to be uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.3 million and $0.7 million at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If the Company\\u2019s ability to collect these receivables and the financial viability of our partners is materially different than estimated, the Company\\u2019s estimate of the allowance could be materially impacted. American accounted for approximately 54%, 56% and 64% of the Company\\u2019s total revenue for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. United accounted for approximately 46%, 44% and 36% of the Company\\u2019s total revenue for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A termination of either the American or the United capacity purchase agreement would have a material adverse effect on the Company\\u2019s business prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 5. Intangible Assets Information about the intangible assets of the Company at September 30, 2018 and 2017, were as follows (in thousands): Total amortization expense recognized was approximately $0.4 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Company expects to record amortization expense of $1.8 million for 2019, and $1.5 million, $1.2 million, $1.0 million, $0.9 million for fiscal years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, respectively. 6. Balance Sheet Information Certain significant amounts included in the Company\\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, consisted of the following (in thousands): Depreciation expense totaled $64.6 million, $60.7 million and $45.6 million for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company recorded amortization of the unfavorable lease liability amounting to $6.6 million, $6.8 million and $6.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a reduction to lease expense. During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company wrote off $1.2 million of unfavorable lease liability related to the lease termination of its aircraft lease facility with Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National Association, as owner trustee and lessor (the \\u201cGECAS Lease Facility\\u201d), which was accounted for as lease termination expense. 7. Fair Value Measurements The Company did not measure any of its assets or liabilities at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2018 and 2017. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable included on the consolidated balance sheets approximated fair value at September 30, 2018 and 2017. The Company\\u2019s debt agreements are not traded on an active market. The Company has determined the estimated fair value of its debt to be Level 3, as certain inputs used to determine the fair value of these agreements are unobservable and, therefore, could be sensitive to changes in inputs. The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of Level 3 debt. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company\\u2019s long-term debt, including current maturities, were as follows (in millions): (1) Current and prior period long-term debts\\u2019 carrying and fair values exclude net debt issuance costs. 8. Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowings Long-term debt as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, consisted of the following (in thousands): (1) In fiscal 2005, the Company financed five CRJ-900 aircraft with $118 million in debt.

The debt bears interest at the monthly LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.95% to 7.25% (4.211% to 9.511% at September 30, 2018) and requires monthly principal and interest payments. (5) In fiscal 2014, the Company financed eight CRJ-900 aircraft with $114.5 million in debt. The debt bears interest at 5% and requires monthly principal and interest payments. (6) In fiscal 2015, the Company financed seven CRJ-900 aircraft with $170.2 million in debt. The senior notes payable of $151 million bear interest at monthly LIBOR plus 2.71% (4.971% at September 30, 2018) and require monthly principal and interest payments. The subordinated notes payable are noninterest-bearing and become payable in full on the last day of the term of the notes. The Company has imputed an interest rate of 6.25% on the subordinated notes payable and recorded a related discount of $8.1 million, which is being accreted to interest expense over the term of the notes. (7) In fiscal 2016, the Company financed 10 E-175 aircraft with $246 million in debt under an EETC financing arrangement (see discussion below). The debt bears interest ranging from 4.75% to 6.25% and requires semi-annual principal and interest payments. (8) In fiscal 2016, the Company financed eight E-175 aircraft with $195.3 million in debt. The senior notes payable of $172 million bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 2.20% to 2.32% (4.598% to 4.718% at September 30, 2018) and require quarterly principal and interest payments. The subordinated notes payable bear interest at 4.50% and require quarterly principal and interest payments. (9) In fiscal 2017, the Company financed certain flight equipment with $99.1 million in debt. The debt bears interest at the monthly LIBOR (rounded to the nearest 16th) plus 7.25% (9.511% at September 30, 2018) and requires monthly principal and interest payments. (10) In December 2017, the Company refinanced nine CRJ-900 aircraft with $74.9 million in debt. The senior notes payable of $46.9 million bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 3.50% (5.898% at September 30, 2018) and require quarterly principal and interest payments. The subordinated notes payable bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 4.50% (6.898% at September 30, 2018) and require quarterly principal and interest payments. (11) In fiscal 2015, the Company financed certain flight equipment with $8.3 million in debt. The debt bears interest at 5.163% and requires monthly principal and interest payments. (12) In fiscal 2015 and 2016, the Company financed certain flight equipment maintenance costs with $10.2 million in debt. The debt bears interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 3.07% (5.468% at September 30, 2018) and requires quarterly principal and interest payments. (13) In fiscal 2016 and 2017, the Company financed certain flight equipment maintenance costs with $11.9 million in debt. The debt bears interest at the three-month LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 2.93% to 2.96% (5.328% to 5.358% at September 30, 2018) and requires quarterly principal and interest payments. The debt is subject to a fixed charge ratio covenant. As of September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with this covenant. (14) In fiscal 2017, the Company financed certain flight equipment maintenance costs with $25 million in debt. The debt bears interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 3.30% (5.698% at September 30, 2018) and requires quarterly principal and interest payments. The debt is subject to a fixed charge ratio covenant. As of September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with this covenant. (15) In fiscal 2016, the Company obtained a $35 million working capital draw loan, which terminates in August 2019. Interest is assessed on drawn amounts at one-month LIBOR plus 4.25% (6.511% at September 30, 2018). The line was drawn upon during fiscal 2017. The working capital draw loan is subject to an interest and rental coverage ratio covenant. As of September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with this covenant. (16) In February 2018, the Company leased two spare engines. The leases were determined to be capital as the leases contain a bargain purchase option at the end of the term. Imputed interest is 9.128% and the leases requires monthly payments. (17) In June 2018, the Company refinanced six CRJ-900 aircraft with $27.5 million in debt and financed nine CRJ-900 aircraft, which were previously leased, with $69.6 million in debt. The senior notes payable of $65.8 million bear interest at the three-month LIBOR plus 3.50% (5.898% at September 30, 2018) and require quarterly principal and interest payments. The subordinated notes payable bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 7.50% (9.898% at September 30, 2018) and require quarterly principal and interest payments. Principal maturities of long-term debt as of September 30, 2018, and for each of the next five years are as follows (in thousands): The net book value of collateralized aircraft and equipment as of September 30, 2018 was $1,047.6 million. In December 2015, an Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (\\u201cEETC\\u201d) pass-through trust was created to issue pass-through certificates to obtain financing for new E-175 aircraft. At September 30, 2018, Mesa has $209.2 million of equipment notes outstanding issued under the EETC financing included in long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. The structure of the EETC financing consists of a pass-through trust created by Mesa to issue pass-through certificates, which represent fractional undivided interests in the pass-through trust and are not obligations of Mesa. The proceeds of the issuance of the pass-through certificates were used to purchase equipment notes which were issued by Mesa and secured by its aircraft. The payment obligations under the equipment notes are those of Mesa. Proceeds received from the sale of pass-through certificates were initially held by a depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until Mesa issued equipment notes to the trust, which purchased such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds. Mesa evaluated whether the pass-through trust formed for its EETC financing is a Variable Interest Entity (\\u201cVIE\\u201d) and required to be consolidated. The pass-through trust was determined to be a VIE, however, the Company has determined that it does not have a variable interest in the pass-through trust, and therefore, has not consolidated the pass-through trust with its financial statements. On June 27, 2018, the Company refinanced $16.0 million of debt on six CRJ-900 aircraft (due in 2019), with $27.5 million of debt, resulting in net cash proceeds to the Company of $10.4 million after transaction related fees. The notes payable require quarterly payments of principal and interest through fiscal 2022 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 3.50%. On June 28, 2018, the Company purchased nine CRJ-900 aircraft, which were previously leased under the GECAS Lease Facility, for $76.5 million. The Company financed the aircraft purchase with $69.6 million in new debt and proceeds from the June 2018 refinancing of six CRJ-900 aircraft. The notes payable of $69.6 million require quarterly payments of principal and interest through fiscal 2022 bearing interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 3.50% for the senior promissory notes to 7.50% for the subordinated promissory notes. The Company recorded non-cash lease termination expense of $15.1 million in connection with the lease buyout. Also, as part of the transaction, the Company (i) received $4.5 million of future goods and services credits and $5.6 million of loan forgiveness for loans with a maturity date in 2027 from the aircraft manufacturer, and (ii) mutually agreed with GE Capital Aviation Services LLC to terminate the GE Warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock. On August 14, 2018 the Company paid down the outstanding balance on the CIT Revolving Credit Facility of $25.7 million. 9. Earnings Per Share Calculations of net income per common share were as follows (in thousands, except per share data): Basic income per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Mesa Air Group by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The number of incremental shares from the assumed issuance of shares relating to restricted stock and exercise of warrants is calculated by applying the treasury stock method. Share-based awards and warrants whose impact is considered to be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method were excluded from the diluted net income or loss per share calculation. In loss periods, these incremental shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share, as the inclusion of unvested restricted stock and warrants would have an anti-dilutive effect. There were no anti-dilutive shares relating to restricted stock and exercise of warrants that were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 10. Common Stock The Company previously issued warrants to third parties, which had a five-year term to be converted to common stock at an exercise price of $0.004 per share. Outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock are held by persons who are not U.S. citizens. The warrants are not exercisable due to restrictions imposed by federal law requiring that no more than 24.9% of our stock be voted, directly or indirectly, or controlled by persons who are not U.S. citizens. The warrants can be converted to common stock upon warrant holders demonstrating U.S. citizenship. During June 2018, the Company extended the term of outstanding warrants set to expire by five years (through fiscal year 2023). Any warrants that were not extended were forfeited. On June 28, 2018, the Company agreed with GE Capital Aviation Services LLC (\\u201cGE Capital\\u201d) to terminate a warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock held by GE Capital. Our shares of common stock became listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \\u201cMESA\\u201d effective August 10, 2018. In July 2018, the Company\\u2019s Board of Directors and Compensation Committee approved the issuance of shares of restricted common stock under its 2018 Plan immediately following completion of the Company\\u2019s IPO to certain of its employees and directors in exchange for the cancellation of existing restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs. The shares of restricted common stock issued under the 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs are subject to vesting on the same terms set forth in the prior vesting schedules and are not subject to acceleration in connection with the 2018 Plan issuances. On August 8, 2018, the Company filed its Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which, among other things: (i) effected a 2.5-for-1 stock split of its common stock; and (ii) increased the authorized number of shares of its common and preferred stock to 125,000,000 and 5,000,000, respectively. All references to share and per share amounts in the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively revised to reflect the stock split and increase in authorized shares. On August 14, 2018, the Company completed its IPO, in which it issued and sold 9,630,000 shares of common stock, no par value, at a public offering price of $12.00 per share (the \\u201cFirm Shares\\u201d). Additionally, in connection with the IPO, the Company granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 1,444,500 shares of common stock at the same price. On September 11, 2018, the Company closed the sale of 1,344,500 shares (\\u201cOption Shares\\u201d) of its common stock, in connection with the partial exercise of the overallotment option granted to the underwriters in its IPO. Of the 1,344,500 Option Shares sold, 723,985 were purchased directly from the Company and the remaining 620,515 shares were purchased directly from the selling shareholders. The Firm Shares and Option Shares were sold to the public for a price of $12.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the IPO were approximately $124.2 million. We received $111.7 million in net proceeds after deducting $8.7 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and $3.8 million in offering costs. We have not historically paid dividends on shares of our common stock. Additionally, our RASPRO Lease Facility and GECAS Lease Facility contain restrictions that limit our ability to or prohibit us from paying dividends to holders of our common stock. 11. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes consists of the following: Reconciliation between the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations and the statutory tax rate is as follows: The Company's deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: We have federal and state income tax NOL carryforwards of $415.1 million and $199.6 million, which expire in 2027-2037 and 2019-2038, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state NOL carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $1.9 million in fiscal year 2018 and $2.6 million in fiscal year 2017 on the deferred tax assets related to these state NOL carryforwards. If or when recognized, the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. The federal and state NOL carryforwards in the income tax returns filed included unrecognized tax benefits. The deferred tax assets recognized for those NOLs are presented net of these unrecognized tax benefits. Because of the change of ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, use of a portion of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be limited in future periods. Further, a portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities. The initial public offering in August of 2018 resulted in a change in ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Based on the valuation of the Company's stock as of the initial public offering date, the Company does not believe any limitation on the utilization of the Company's current net operating losses would be applicable as of September 30, 2018. As a result of adopting ASU 2016-09, the table of deferred tax assets and liabilities includes $0.4 million of deferred tax assets previously unrecognized that arose directly from, or the use of which was postponed by, tax deductions related to equity compensation greater than the compensation recognized for financial reporting. These previously recognized deferred tax assets are related to excess tax benefits incurred in years prior to September 30, 2018. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits are $4.7 million, $7.5 million and $7.5 million of tax benefits as of September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, that, if recognized, would result in adjustments to primarily deferred taxes. The decrease in the year ended September 30, 2018 is a result of the change in federal tax rate that reduces the benefit that would be recognized if the unrecognized tax benefit was resolved favorably. We recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense. We have not recorded accrued penalties or interest related to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above as the amounts would result in an adjustment to NOL carry forwards. We are subject to taxation in the United States and various states. As of September 30, 2018, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state examinations by taxing authorities for years prior to 1999. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \\u201cTax Act\\u201d). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affected the Company\\u2019s fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, including but not limited to (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate, (2) changing rules related to uses and limitations of NOL carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (\\u201cAMT\\u201d) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, and (4) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property. The Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% in our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The Internal Revenue Code stipulates that the Company\\u2019s fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, will have a blended corporate tax rate of 24.5%, which is based on the applicable tax rates before and after the Tax Act and the number of days in the year. The SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company\\u2019s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act. In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we have recorded a discrete net tax benefit of $22.0 million in the period ending September 30, 2018. As discussed more fully below, the Company has not completed its accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act. The Company has recorded provisional adjustments where reasonable adjustments are available. Where reasonable adjustments are not available, the Company has not recorded any provisional adjustments and continues to account for them in accordance with ASC 740. Our accounting for the following elements of the Tax Act is complete: Reduction of U.S. federal corporate tax rate: The Act reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we have recorded a decrease related to our net deferred tax liabilities of $22.0 million, excluding the valuation allowance. The Company has also estimated an increase to its valuation allowance of $0.5 million due to the rate change. We have recorded a corresponding net adjustment to deferred income tax benefit of $21.5 million for the period ending September 30, 2018. Elimination of Corporate AMT and Refund of AMT Credits: For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the corporate AMT was repealed. The Act allows the use of existing corporate AMT credits to offset regular tax liability for tax years after December 31, 2017. AMT credits in excess of regular liability are refundable in the years 2018 through 2021. At September 30, 2018, the Company had $2.5 million of AMT credits, all of which is expected to be refunded. We have reclassified the AMT credits to long-term receivable. The Company was not able to make reasonable estimates or, correspondingly, record provisional adjustments for the following: Valuation allowances: The Company must determine whether the state valuation allowance assessments are affected by various aspects of the Tax Act (e.g. section 163(j), state effect of The Act, net operating loss carryforwards). Any corresponding determinations relating to changes in valuation allowances have, likewise, not been completed or recorded. 12. Share-Based Compensation Restricted Stock In July 2018, the Company\\u2019s Board of Directors and Compensation Committee approved the issuance of shares of restricted common stock under its 2018 Plan immediately following the IPO to certain of its employees and directors in exchange for the cancellation of existing restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs. The shares of restricted common stock issued under the 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs are subject to vesting on the same terms set forth in the prior vesting schedules and are not subject to acceleration in connection with the 2018 Plan issuances. There were 966,022 vested SARs which were cancelled, exchanged for shares of restricted common stock and issued as restricted stock upon completion of the IPO. The Company\\u2019s Board of Directors is authorized to issue 2,500,000 shares of common stock to management under the 2018 Plan. Immediately following the IPO, 2,249,147 shares were issued to certain of its employees and directors under the 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of 491,915 unvested restricted phantom stock units, 491,198 unvested restricted shares issued under the 2011 and 2017 Plans and 1,266,034 SARs (966,022 vested and 300,012 unvested). The Company has the right to withhold shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations and the withheld shares become available for future grants. The shares are valued at grant date based upon recent share transactions. From inception of the 2011 Plan through IPO, 2,448,905 shares have been granted, 1,978,550 shares have vested and 470,355 shares have been cancelled. From inception of the 2017 Plan, 31,255 shares have been granted, 10,412 have vested and 20,843 shares have been cancelled. From inception of the 2018 Plan, 2,249,147 shares have been awarded and 998,522 shares have vested. The restricted stock activity for our years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows: Stock Appreciation Rights In 2014, the Company implemented a share-based payment plan under which certain executives and directors are eligible to receive grants of SARs (the \\u201cSARs Plan\\u201d). The SARs provide a participant with the right to receive the aggregate appreciation in stock price over the market price of the Company\\u2019s common stock at the date of grant, payable in cash. The participant may exercise his or her SARs quarterly after the grant is vested but no later than 10 years after the date of grant. The SARs awards vest ratably over a three year period from the date of grant. The Company had authorized 5,000,000 shares under this plan and had granted 4,204,993 since inception of the plan. Since inception of the plan, 3,687,218 of SARs have vested and 2,088,333 of SARs have been exercised. In August 2018, upon IPO, 517,775 unvested SARs and 1,598,885 vested SARs were cancelled in exchange for 300,012 and 966,022 shares of restricted stock under the 2018 Plan, respectively. The SARs activity for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows: Phantom Stock On October 17, 2017, the Company implemented a share-based payment plan under which employees, officers, directors and other individuals providing services to the Company are eligible to receive grants of restricted phantom stock units (\\u201cPhantom Stock Plan\\u201d). The restricted phantom stock units (\\u201crestricted stock units\\u201d or \\u201cRSUs\\u201d) provide a participant with the right to receive a cash or stock bonus based on the fair market value of a stated number of RSUs that are vested. The shares of Common Stock that may be subject to RSUs granted under the Plan shall not exceed an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares. All of the RSUs are non-vested and forfeitable as of the grant date and vest over a three-year period. Any vested RSU will be settled by the Company upon vesting but no later than March 15 of the calendar year after the date that the RSUs become vested. The Company had authorized 1,250,000 shares under this plan and had granted 536,538 since inception of the plan. Since inception of the plan, 44,623 RSUs have vested or settled. In August 2018, upon completion of our IPO, 491,915 unvested RSUs were cancelled in exchange for shares of restricted stock under the 2018 Plan. The phantom stock activity for the year ended September 30, 2018 were summarized as follows: Following the IPO there will be no further grants under the Stock Appreciation Rights and Phantom Stock plans. Immediately following the IPO, shares of restricted common stock were issued to certain of its employees and directors under its 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of existing restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs. The shares of restricted common stock issued under the 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs are subject to vesting on the same terms set forth in the prior vesting schedules and are not subject to acceleration in connection with the 2018 Plan issuances. As of September 30, 2018, there was $8.8 million, of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. Compensation cost for share-based awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Share-based compensation expense for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $12.9 million, $2.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expenses are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 13. Commitments At September 30, 2018, the Company leased 28 aircraft under noncancelable operating leases with remaining terms of up to 5.5 years. The Company has the option to terminate certain leases at various times throughout the lease. The Company headquarters and other facility noncancelable operating leases have remaining terms of up to nine years. The leases require the Company to pay all taxes, maintenance, insurance, and other operating expenses. Rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, net of lessor rebates and other incentives. Aggregate rental expense under all operating aircraft, equipment and facility leases totaled approximately $85.9 million, $83.8 million and $84.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Future minimum lease payments as of September 30, 2018, under noncancelable operating leases are as follows (in thousands): The majority of the Company\\u2019s leased aircraft are leased through trusts that have a sole purpose to purchase, finance, and lease these aircraft to the Company; therefore, they meet the criteria of a variable interest entity. However, since these are single-owner trusts in which the Company does not participate, the Company is not at risk for losses and is not considered the primary beneficiary. Management believes that the Company\\u2019s maximum exposure under these leases is the remaining lease payments. 14. Contingencies The Company is involved in various legal proceedings (including, but not limited to, insured claims) and FAA civil action proceedings that the Company does not believe will have a material adverse effect upon its business, financial condition, or results of operations, although no assurance can be given to the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. 15. Selected Consolidated Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited) The following table sets forth certain unaudited selected consolidated financial information for each of the four quarters in the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. In management\\u2019s opinion, this unaudited consolidated quarterly selected information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and includes all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which management considers necessary for a fair presentation when read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes. We believe these comparisons of consolidated quarterly selected financial data are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Quarterly EPS may not total to the fiscal year EPS due to the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the end of each period reported and rounding.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
